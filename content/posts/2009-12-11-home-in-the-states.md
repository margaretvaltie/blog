Wednesday Jacob and I got back to the US after more than a full day of flying.    We flew from Accra to London, and London to Chicago.  In Chicago, Jacob’s dad met us outside of security with a deep-dish pizza from Carmen’s .  He drove me to my terminal, where I had to say goodbye to Jacob and fly on to Wichita.  Everyone certainly thought I was crazy as we walked through snow and 7 degree weather out to the plane, but I only had on a thin long-sleeved shirt and flip flops.

We will both be traveling around the US before departing again on our Around the World adventure.
