After a week of slowly recovering from our illness, Jacob and I went back to work Thursday.  We survived the week, even though we got little accomplished in the office.  On Friday Hayford had us fill out some grant information on a health clinic in a village about an hour away.  We found out it’s the home town of our pharmacist friend, Forson.  He was the wonderful one who brought us some stomach meds while we were sick.  We’ve been working with Forson to restart a health newspaper called _Health Focus_ so it was a nice little trade off_._ Friday we read over the clinic’s requests for things like a ‘couch’, living areas for nurses, a delivery set, and so on.  Jacob and I weren’t exactly sure what these things were but it was obvious from their paperwork that they did a substantial amount of work for the community.  We wrote a basic grant request on behalf of them- they’ve helped over 2,000 people since opening in December 2008 and have only 3 nurses on staff.

Saturday we went to visit the village and the health clinic, about an hour from where we live.  Hayford drove and our new volunteer from the UK, Charles, came along for the ride. After spending Friday writing about them, it was really cool to see it in real life.  As it turns out, their funding requests seem so small compared to what work they do.  The ‘couch’ they requested is what they call the bed they treat patents on- the current version is just a narrow, high table with padding on top.  The nurses frequently have to stay overnight to treat patients, and they sleep on wooden benches now.

The clinic is a project of the Action Youth Club of the Amanase village. The president and some of the members showed us around the clinic and answered our questions about the grant proposal.  We walked around the clinic, proposed site for additions, and an abandoned house that could serve as housing for nurses who need to stay overnight.  Next door to the clinic is a warehouse for coco beans that will be exported to eventually become chocolate.  Our guides explained the coco bean process, and broke open a raw cocoa fruit and had us try the raw coco beans and then taste the dried beans.  One guy gave me a cocoa fruit to take home&#8230; I’m not sure what I was supposed to do with it- make chocolate?

After our tour we walked into the center of the village to the chief’s palace.  It was a 2 story wooden, U-shaped building with the Club’s headquarters on the outer side.  Inside the courtyard we got to meet the big chief of the area.  He was a huge man, maybe 6 1/2 feet, and watching everyone else show him sooo much respect was really cool.  He wanted to know our names, where we&#8217;re from and what cities we live in the US.

Before heading back, we got coconuts and took a group photo.  Experiencing the village and seeing the clinic in action was very rewarding and motivating.  They only need really basic things just to make a big difference. It was really interesting to see a grant proposal come alive like that.



Saturday we went to the village of Amanase to visit the clinic we&#8217;re currently writing a grant on behalf of.  The employees and local youth organization led us around the sadly under-equipped hospital, answered our questions for the grant, introduced us to their chief, and fed us wonderful coconuts.  These are photos of the clinic, our guides, and the group, including our new VPWA volunteer, Charles.
