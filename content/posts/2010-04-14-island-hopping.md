After we changed our plans and canceled the flights to Thailand we suddenly had about 10 extra days before our flight to Yangoon, Myanmar.  We consulted the guidebooks and decided a few nice islands in Malaysia might be a fun, less-packed alternative to Thai beaches.

On Thursday we caught the overnight “Jungle Railway” that runs from Kuala Lumpur south to tiny jungle towns and all the way up the peninsula to the east coast.  After the 13 hour train ride we then took a 2 hour cab ride to the port town and a hair-raising 30 minute speed boat to Pulau Perhentian.  Our little island (literally named little island) is called Perhentian Kecil and apparently home to the more hip travelers.

Coral Bay, our beach, had about 10 guesthouses and restaurants and 3 or 4 dive operations.  We were set for all our activities on the island.  Each restaurant had wonderful smoothies or “ice blends” of fresh fruit or candy bars in towering soda fountain-style glasses.  The food was a refreshing mix of Western staples and outstanding local dishes, including nightly bar-b-ques.

I lazed around the beach while Jacob made 3 dives in the 4 days we were on the island.  He dove his first shipwrecks- one was an older Vietnamese ship that crashed in a storm, and the other ship was a recent wreck that has yet to gather much sea life.  His instructors secretly let him into parts of both ships to get the full shipwreck experience.  One of the dive instructors later bragged about how they were the “most loving dive company” because a man diving the Vietnamese wreck realized he lost his wedding ring.  They returned to the dive shop, loaded up on new tanks of air and recruited everyone working in the shop to come look for the ring.  The most loving dive shop actually did find his ring on the return dive.

On our last day on the island Jacob and I snorkeled the bay and around the corner to the next2 beaches.  I wasn’t expecting to see much since the island has had issues with massive coral damage and pollution but the sights were outstanding.  Just in the shallow water by the dive shop there were tons of little fish swimming right up to the beach and all types of corals further out.  As we snorkeled we came across at least 11 giant bottle-headed parrot fish munching on coral.  They must have each been about 1-2 feet long and incredibly ugly.  Jacob pointed out several sea anemones and families of clownfish “Nemo”.  It was a surprisingly good snorkel. I’m glad I’m not completely jaded by the amazing Great Barrier Reef.

After 4 days we hopped to the west coast, via a trip in and out of KL.  We are now on the island of Langkawi which is known to the be the party island and blissfully duty-free.  The only real tax break is on the alcohol which is R3-5 ($1-2) here and otherwise about R15-20 ($5-6). The island is clearly more established as the tourist destination with roads full of shops selling sundresses and aloe, Western restaurants and tour packages.

We arrived in the late afternoon and found a decent room at the Gecko guesthouse.  Most of the other guests are fellow long-trip travelers from Europe.  We quickly made friends with our deck of cards and the small groups in the garden became a massive group by the end of the first night.  Our plans continue to be lazing around the beach, catching more sun, and touring the island’s restaurants.  It’s a hard life on islands.
