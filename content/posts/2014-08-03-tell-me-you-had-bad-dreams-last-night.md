Last night I had a very weird dream that woke me with a start.

The beginning is very fuzzy. I was in a house, possibly my paternal grandparents house. In real life my family is hoping to sell it after they both passed away this year. I spent many weekends, holidays, birthdays and summer nights visiting them there. Every Christmas Eve my dad&#8217;s side of the family opened gifts there, until the visits shifted to nursing homes and hospitals. It&#8217;s a modest, 3 bedroom house built after the War. I always remember the windows looking out on the side yards and the backyard where my grandfather grew a large garden and tinkered in the garage.

In my dream I was with a group of friends, none of whom I really recognized. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve worn glasses or contacts since I was in third grade, but all my dreams are pretty fuzzy visually. I know that people are friends, or there are trees, colors, whatever but I just can&#8217;t see them clearly. Anyway, these friends and I were gathered around 2 single beds in a room with windows on 3 sides. It was almost like a screened in porch with so much light. The hallway to the rest of the house was on my right. I was sitting up in one of the single beds, looking at my friends.

I don&#8217;t know what started it, but one of my friends was clearly in trouble with the police. He was in an altercation, with a policeman (?) in the hall. The policeman wanted my friend to come with him, but we somehow got our friend out of the fix and had him stay.

We were all afraid after the policeman left. We hid our friend in the copious blankets from the bed, between the wall and the beds. He laid down on his side but had to stick his head out a bit to breathe.  After some time we started talking and laughing with the group. I remember that I was sitting up in bed because I think I was playing with the top of the soft comforter.

Aside &#8211; my friend in trouble was Black. I don&#8217;t have any close friends who are Black. Nothing implied here, I just am not close with Black Americans. Why was this friend black and the others were so blurry I couldn&#8217;t see them? Why was the Black one in trouble? You tell me, subconscious.

So, here we are laughing in a bright, open room. I&#8217;m sitting on a soft bed, hiding a friend with the other ends of the blankets. I remember looking down at his face, sticking out of the blankets just a bit, and seeing him with a worried look. I turned quickly to my left. Out the window was a very dark, large shadow of a man.

It freaked me out and I woke up, my heart racing.

What was that about? No clue. I do scare easily. I wrote a silly short story for my high school literary magazine about how much I am frightened by inanimate objects.

But, I also remember one of the scariest dreams from my childhood. It was a bit similar.

I was in my family&#8217;s house. We were on the first floor, and my brother and mom were in the kitchen about 30 feet away from me. The light was on in that room, but for some reason I was sitting on the edge of our sofa in a dark living room. It was night outside, so the room was dark, but the moonlight came in above the slatted wooden window shades to my left.

I sat and watched my brother and mother cooking something (not normal), when suddenly a wolf busted through the wooden shades on my left. Only in this dream, I didn&#8217;t wake up with a start. Instead, I was so scared I couldn&#8217;t make a sound. I wanted to warn my family but I was so close to the thing and so freaked out I couldn&#8217;t even whisper.

So, similarities:  sitting inside a house, recognizing people I care about nearby, scary dark things popping out at me from the left. Just putting it out there.
