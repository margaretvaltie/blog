Most of Romania wasn&#8217;t exactly a tourist sight&#8230;  
The Romanian Peasant museum from the outside- we suspected the giant building was an official Communist building in a previous life.  
a restaurant recomendation took us down a non-existant street, where people walked on the suspended wooden sidewalks like it was completely normal.  
The Romanian parliament- the 2nd largest building in the world, after the Pentagon. Â Jacob decided if we discover giants we should meet with them here.  
On the train again- sunset on the night train to Bulgaria
