After I got married I was surprises how few resources there were for going through the name change process. Many people get married and move right after, so it&#8217;s no surprise that most brides who chose to change their names put it off. &nbsp;It can be a tedious process, but I found that keeping that wedding prep energy up was the only way I could have done it so quickly.

Much of the name change process is dependent on other steps, so clearly a flowchart is in order!

## Step 1: Marriage license

Obviously, the first step is to get married and have the marriage documents. Easier said than done, since my documents had to go from the church back to the state government before they eventually got mailed to me. A few places require the original license (no copies), so go ahead and order multiple documents.

## Step 2: Social Security

Once you have a marriage certificate, that counts as proof of a legal name change. You&#8217;ll also need proof of citizenship and proof of your identity. Your passport can do double duty for this. Fill out the name change application. With those docs in hand, <a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/How-do-I-change-or-correct-my-name-on-my-Social-Security-number-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit a social security office.</a>

Protip: don&#8217;t go on the last Friday of the month. Rookie mistake by me!

## Step 3: Important IDs

Once your Federal name change goes through (24+ hours after the Social Security) you can change your name on other government IDs. I&#8217;d recommend just waiting to get your new social security card in hand, though. At the DMV, I only needed the new social and marriage license.

For a new passport, you&#8217;ll have to apply via snail mail. Include your old passport, 2 new passport pictures, proof of the name change, and the fee for the name change.&nbsp;<a href="https://pptform.state.gov/PassportWizardMain.aspx#%7B%22__s%22%3A%22E%2FzBh9L%2FxaRcUTe42nPBGilj3Nyzi%2F%2B4n48bTi20uh1MorN3MTgPy40B5quRKqh1qONguzDwo8UDtA%2Bnydf%2FDjx8ODh5mQCsPXhbbqUR50VuDA4jPwdb6EvJqWk%3D%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can also apply online here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great time to use those marriage certificate copies.

## Step 4: Key Accounts

I say &#8220;key accounts&#8221; since it might vary depending on what you need to do in the next month or two after your wedding. If you&#8217;re moving in 4 months, don&#8217;t bother updating your utilities. If you&#8217;re adding a spouse to your health insurance then that becomes more important. This also falls into the &#8220;it depends&#8221; area for what documentation you&#8217;ll need, so more copies of that license come in handy.

This area could include:

  * your HR department, including payroll and benefits
  * healthcare / insurance
  * utilities
  * bank accounts / direct deposits
  * credit cards
  * loans, mortgages, student loans, rent

## Step 5: Important, but not Urgent

Like step 4, it depends. I don&#8217;t know anyone who gets vital postal mail but it&#8217;s still important to get your name updated eventually. If you&#8217;ve got anything coming up, plan for that first &#8211; ie, voting registration if an election is coming up, or if you&#8217;re a licensed professional with a certification renewal.

  * Voter registration
  * investment accounts (and add a beneficiary if you haven&#8217;t already)
  * doctors offices, dentists, and healthcare records
  * professional licensing boards or certifications
  * other insurance: life, auto, home, etc
  * email &#8211; you can redirect your existing email to go to one with your new name and have replies automatically come from your new email

## Step 6: Don&#8217;t forget&#8230;

Nagging little things you should change now because you&#8217;re on a roll. Such as:

  * alumni office
  * mail subscriptions, magazines, professional groups, etc
  * airlines, hotels, car rentals, and other rewards accounts
  * library cards
  * online accounts from social media to PayPal

## Other things learned along the way:

  * If you&#8217;re also moving, change your address first! It&#8217;s way easier to update addresses on important things like your mail, credit cards, banks, etc.
  * Check your state&#8217;s guidelines for changing your ID before or after your social. I&#8217;ve been told in CA you have to do it first in state, then social.
  * Apparently it&#8217;s easier to make a name change to replace your last name and keep your middle name. That might just be the woman at the DMV.
  * Yes, this is a cis-normative, gender traditional name change flowchart. Just swap out &#8220;marriage license&#8221; for legal name change and it&#8217;s hopefully still useful!
