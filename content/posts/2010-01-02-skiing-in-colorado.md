Sunday Dad, David, Mom and I began our annual ski trip in Colorado.  Our early flight and quick drive got us in to <a href="http://www.beavercreek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaver Creek</a> in time for the boys to have a few hours of skiing while Mom and I settled into our routine of reading, watching bowl games, and cross stitching.   The first 3 days were bright and great skiing weather for Dad and David.

Tuesday my Tulane friend Madison drove up from Salida to visit for the day.  We caught up and talked most of the day and we were all a bit surprised when she did take us up on the offer to go out to dinner with us.  The 5 of us had dinner at the Golden Eagle and grabbed some gelato.  By then it had started lightly snowing, so Madison said goodbye and headed home.  Only about an hour later Jacob got in from his long drive.   Luckily, Jacob had shipped his skis and boots ahead of time so that he only had one little bag with him.

Wednesday Jacob, Dad and David hit the slopes.  The snow was still falling from the night before and apparently the powder and lack of visibility were more challenging than the previous days.  All 3 came in a bit early and eagerly hit the hot tub to unwind. That night we went out to dinner at Grouse Mountain Grill, one of my favorites in Beaver Creek.

Thursday the boys went out skiing again. In the afternoon we all watched the wonderful movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkqzFUhGPJg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UP </a>and ordered a pizza.  For our New Year&#8217;s Eve ritual we ate pizza, drank beer, and rejoiced at UT&#8217;s loss in the Chic-fil-A bowl.  We heard the village would have a firework show around 7.30, so being the Walkers we headed down at 7.30 promptly.   The 5 of us went to the hot tub to see the fireworks show, but apparently there were some delays with the ski show and the fireworks.  We almost gave up after toasting in the tub for about 30 minutes when a lone explosion came from the direction of the fireworks setup.   Another sparse few fireworks convinced us to stay, and in another 10 minutes the show started up.  Maybe to make up for the strange start, the fireworks seemed bigger and brighter than years before.   After the fireworks we went back inside and got to watch the ball drop in New York at 10pm.
