Sunday morning Jacob and I had one last meal of pho, the Vietnamese national dish.  Pho, pronounced like “fuh” is a noodle soup with meat or fish and vegetables usually eaten for breakfast.  When we were in Melbourne, Australia Jacob’s cousin Paul took us to his favorite Vietnamese restaurant.  The Aussie- Vietnamese owner gave us his card and the information for his family’s restaurant in Hanoi. He told us to go early to get pho, which seemed strange to us at the time.  Sunday we hired 2 moped taxis to drive across the river to the new part of town and Long’s family restaurant.

As we got off the bikes Jacob slightly burned his leg, but the commotion brought the owner outside.  Jacob showed him Long’s card and the information for this restaurant and the owner’s face quickly lit up when he saw his son’s handwriting.  The owner ushered us inside, brought us pho, and even got a bandage for Jacob’s leg.  The pho was outstanding and a nice friend of the family acted as an interpreter for us and the family.  We took a photo to send to Long and set off for the airport.

We heard there was a bus from Hanoi to Vientiane, the capital of Laos.  Our hotel office, the same one that sold us the Ha Long Bay tour, assured us it was a 14 hour bus ride between capitals but we were suspicious.  The distance on the map seemed large compared to the distance we went on night buses, so we looked for other traveler’s advice online. I was convinced to fly when I read accounts of the trip taking up to 36 hours and never less than 24 hours.

Our little propeller plane arrived in Vientiane just 2 hours later and we split a cab into town with a Kiwi couple, Becks and John O.  The four of us hotel searched together and then went to dinner. Becks is an avid pool player so we spent much of the night playing and watching pool.  The next day we all headed north to one of the most popular town in Northern Laos for some tubing and trekking.
