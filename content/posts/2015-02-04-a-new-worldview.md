It&#8217;s been 5 years since my &#8220;year of summer&#8221; and this blog started. 5 years ago, I had just graduated from college in the lowest dip of the Recession and hit the road.

By the start of 2010 I&#8217;d already been across the ocean on the Queen Mary, wine regions of France, and over land from Latvia to Greece then on to 4 months in Ghana.

&nbsp;

My good friend Jen left this week to go to South America &#8211; exactly 5 years after me &#8211; and I&#8217;m a bit jealous.

Traveling was great. It sounds bizarre to anyone who hasn&#8217;t backpacked for at least a few weeks knows it can get difficult. Language barriers, cultural differences, weird food, and just the mess of travel can start to wear off the fun of adventure and new experiences. South America was hard for me.Â Ghana was very hard. But I probably learned the most in the hard places.

My incomplete list of things that shifted my perspective:

  * Le Ly Hayslip&#8217;s description of white people&#8217;s noses (as opposed to her Vietnamese family) as &#8220;long noses&#8221; in her excellent book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Heaven_and_Earth_Changed_Places" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When Heaven and Earth Change Places</a>
  * Â My regional chief&#8217;s description of &#8220;hair that grows long&#8221; vs. his African tight curls that grow outward. He&#8217;d never felt &#8220;long hair&#8221; before I let him touch my ponytail.
  * The look a woman gave me when she said &#8220;but you&#8217;re a woman. Where are your earrings?&#8221; because in Ghana all women have pierced ears but not always long hair.
  * The most awkward moment of traveling, when new friends all met each other. Our German friends introduced themselves to our Israeli friends, who responded &#8220;We forgive you.&#8221; Yikes. The Americans had a chat with the Germans after along the lines of &#8220;not all Jews think that way&#8221; and hoped it would blow over. We all reunited in Ho Chi Minh City to find the Germans and Israelis all hanging out. World peace in action ðŸ™‚
  * ComingÂ back toÂ the US after living in Ghana, and having many moments likeÂ the cereal aisle scene in Hurt Locker:
