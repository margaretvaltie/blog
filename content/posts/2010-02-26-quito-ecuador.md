Secret Garden hostel- great balcony restaurant and bar

Jacob and I flew from Cuenca to Quito late Monday night and found our ride, Ricardo waiting for us.

Day 1- walk around the old city and the colonial squares

&#8211; Met Aussie/ Kiwi group from Loki Cusco  
&#8211; Met Mary and Helen, Kiwi nurses

Day 2- Mindo Day trip  
Butterfly farm, 10 ziplines across valleys and rivers, Mexican lunch with 2 new friends, Emily and Nate

Emily told a worse story of lost items- on a school trip her backpack was stolen. When she got back to town, her host family&#8217;s house was robbed of all of her things.  The next week her camera was grabbed out of a friend&#8217;s hand.  All in 2 weeks!

Day 3-  
-Walked with Mary and Helen to the markets in the New City  
climbed to the top of the Basilica for amazing views of the city.  We got to climb around the church like no one was watching- through the roof over the nave, up the 2 spires, and along the tower at the front of the church

flew out at 11pm with Carolyn to Buenos Aires. What a terrible flight
