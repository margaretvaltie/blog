Following some news of protests and potential violence in Thailand, Jacob and I opted to change our flight plans. Rather than fly to Bangkok in a few days we are now exploring some islands and the jungle of Malaysia.  
In about 10 days we are going to Myanmar (or Burma) for 10 days. We were told that Americans are generally mistrusted and we were lucky to get visas. Our tour guide will show us all sorts of sites around Yangoon and the rivers. It should be a great trip, and we&#8217;re both very excited. 

As part of our changed plans we had to eliminate the flight to the Philippines. It was the only way to squeeze in another flight to Ho Chi Minh City but it also worked out well since we would have been there right before their big elections. There have been reports about violence in the South, so our cancelation was an early precaution also.  
Now we are off to get our Vietnam visas and plan out our time on the coasts of Malaysia.
