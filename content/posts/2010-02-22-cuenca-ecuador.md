After we spent Friday in the US embassy in Lima, I got a temporary passport that should last until we get to New Zealand.  I can trade it in for a real passport, but I am sad I lost all my stamps and visas from my last one.   Friday night we flew from Lima to Tumbes in the north of Peru.  It was a nice 1 hour flight rather than a 10 hour bus ride through the desolate regions of Peru.

In Tumbes we found a hotel near the bus offices in the &#8216;downtown&#8217; area.  Tumbes was a rather small little town and only had 1 bus company that went from Peru through to Ecuador at midday.  With great timing, we booked our bus, checked out and grabbed an early lunch.  On our lunch quest, Jacob&#8217;s favorite way to get recommendations is to ask tough looking police officers for a good restaurant.  It&#8217;s great to see a tough guy look at us confused, then break into a huge smile while describing his favorite place to get ceviche.

On our way back to the bus office, Jacob and I raced mototaxis.  Especially in smaller towns we&#8217;ve discovered the joys of the little 3 wheeled motorcycles with a bench seat in the back.  Our bus boarded, took us to the Peruvian border, then dropped Jacob and I off in Ecuador to catch another bus.   We had to go ahead to the immigration station but our bus picked us up once we got our stamps.  Over the next 5 hours we climbed again up to the tops of mountains and along deep valleys, much like the ones in Bolivia and inland Peru.   Yet again we are back in the chilly altitudes above 2,500 meters.

Our bus arrived in Cuenca by about 7pm on Saturday night.  At the bus station everyone was so friendly and helpful we were almost worried about it! People with suggestions for hotels, cab drivers and policemen were all asking where we would stay, how long we are in town, etc.  We found a nice hostel and cab, put our bags down and ate dinner.  Cuenca seems to be a very expat-friendly town with international restaurants and signposts in English.

Sunday was a very quiet day.  None of the shops were open except for a few cafes, video stores, and a few people selling crafts on the street. Jacob and I explored the city and plazas, although none of the churches or museums were open.   Today we hope to visit some of the sights before our flight to Quito later tonight.
