It sounds insane to admit, especially during this particular winter. A few weeks ago we got 19 inches of snow, and this week we set record lows for temperature and wind chill.

But all that time not enjoying the outdoors is part of what I enjoy about winter. I get so much more done when I&#8217;m cloistered away in my apartment.

Summer is short and fantastic in Chicago. That means we have to really seize the season and spend all our time outdoors &#8211; in parks, swimming, at the beach, or on a fantastic rooftop. For some reason, most of my Chicago friends have summer birthdays, so that means the summer is full of social events. Plus, everyone just feels like socializing during the summer.

The winter is the time I like to withdraw. I can focus on myself and not feel like I&#8217;m ignoring friends or missing out. It is the time of year when people usually make resolutions, after all.

What&#8217;s even more crazy is that I enjoy running in the winter. Not on treadmills, anything but that! Outdoors. In snow. Below freezing. Because no one else is around, I get to enjoy the Lakeshore Trail or Humboldt Park Hill all by myself. I don&#8217;t have to fight packs of 30+ people training for a marathon at 9:30 minutes mile pace&#8230; or be reminded that I&#8217;ll never be running a marathon at a 9:30.

Not that I won&#8217;t be running a marathon. I&#8217;m currently training for my second Spring marathon this winter. I know I&#8217;ll never run a &#8220;fast&#8221; marathon compared to others. It&#8217;s the challenge that I enjoy, and I feel even more accomplished knowing that I trained and prepared for a spring race through a tough winter.

So maybe that&#8217;s my metaphor? I enjoy winter because I really enjoy the process of self improvement and persistence.
