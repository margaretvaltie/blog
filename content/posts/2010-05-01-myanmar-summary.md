For the last 10 days we&#8217;ve been on a busy tour of Myanmar (Burma), but sadly without much time to write or get on the internet.  Instead of a day-by-day blog I thought it would be better to do a summary of the type of experiences rather than an unexciting list of the myriad pagodas we visited on each day.

**The Tour:  
<span style="font-weight:normal;">We arrived in the capital, Yangon, on Monday and were met by our tour guide&#8217;s cousin, Joe.  Joe took us around Yangon the next day and went out to dinner with us in Chinatown.  The next day we met Ye, our guide for the next 10 days.  Ye showed us around Yangon, Bagan, Mandalay and Inlay Lake.  We toured pagodas, workshops, villages, and religious sites but my favorite parts were the glimpses of daily life- the markets, the docks, and our conversations with Ye. </span>**

**The People:  
<span style="font-weight:normal;">People in Myanmar were wonderful- people watching and interacting with local people was what made the trip so good.  Jacob and I found ourselves talking about Ghana a lot.  It seems like there is the same standard of living, joie de vivre, and entrepreneurial spirit in both peoples. In Yangon we watched men unload bags of rice from boats from the north of the country and women selling vegetables in the large indoor market.  At first I was worried about how few people smiled back at me, unlike Ghana, but I discovered the Burmese people are nice but just not huge smilers.<br /> </span>** ******<span style="font-weight:normal;">At Inlay Lake, Ye brought us to a village of people who live in stilt houses on the edges of the lake.  We floated around in the shallow water until we found a family at home to visit.  The grandmother helped us out of the boat and we climbed the stairs to meet the father and mother, who offered us tea and a sweet snack.  Their 4-5 children sat across the room on the straw mats that made up the floor and our seats.  Ye translated their questions- where are we from, are we married, do we have children, how long are we visiting, and so on.  We took a little tour of their 3 room house, living room, sleeping area, and kitchen with coal stove places. Everyone was incredibly nice and excited to share their little part of life with us. </span>** 

**The Government:  
<span style="font-weight:normal;">The military has been ruling the country since 1989 and a little more focused on turning the country&#8217;s wealth into personal wealth than the people or infrastructure.  Apparently the generals grow rich on blue, white and red- sapphires, heroin, and rubies- but don&#8217;t fund roads, education, and business.  It was clear when we had to travel around the country. We flew to Bagan, which was either a 30 minute flight or a 16 hour drive!<br /> I was worried about the big-brother government spying on foreigners and the citizens, but it seems like I was overly worried.  For our visas applications we were warned not to put anything along the lines of &#8216;student&#8217; &#8216;unemployed&#8217; or &#8216;journalist&#8217; so I put down &#8216;hair stylist&#8217;.  ha.  No one even looked twice at my visa.  People seemed mildly comfortable talking about the government, but once we were in a home or a private place everyone who mentioned it joked about the lack of governing by the general.<br /> The government supplies a &#8216;ration&#8217; of 3 gallons of gasoline to people per day, which is rather inconvenient if a person&#8217;s livelihood involved driving anywhere or transporting goods.  Also, the government supplies only about 8 hours of electricity per day at totally random times.  Most people and businesses have their own generators to have constant power, but they switch over whenever government power is running.  At Ye&#8217;s home we knew by the cheer in the neighborhood that the government power clicked on, but after about 20 seconds it shut off again.  &#8220;Thanks, Mr. General&#8221; we said as Ye got up to switch back to his generator. </span>**

**<span style="font-weight:normal;">Verdict</span><span style="font-weight:normal;">:<br /> Myanmar was wonderful.  It was very interesting to see how well people can adapt to make an economy despite the government.  I can&#8217;t imagine that life in Myanmar is easy by any means but the people do still seem to have a a wonderful outlook and sense of history.  Myanmar is clearly changing, probably more slowly than the international community would like, but I have hope that the country will keep it&#8217;s history and spirit.</span>**
