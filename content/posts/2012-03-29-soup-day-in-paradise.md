   The beach crew has reunited after a few year&#8217;s hiatus. Last year, David and Renee got married in the summer and the year before I missed out on the trip while trip while on my &#8220;year out&#8221;traveling the world.

  This year, all veterans return &#8211; Mom, Dad, David and Renee, Rita and Jason, Shane Magee, and me.  I realized two days in that we&#8217;ve all been here before, which also luckily exempted us from making the semi-obligatory trips to the Baths (the overcrowded tourist beach), the copper mine and the corresponding cheep and sub-par restaurants at both. We opted for a sailboat day snorkeling (ironically on the only day without a breeze) and a days playing in the waves out our front door.

  Today we went to the beach in the morning, and the waves were huge! I think I got picked up about 10 feet in the air. If we caught a wave in, we&#8217;d get swept about 15 feet up the beach. The undertow was really strong and swept us to the right, no matter how hard we swam. It was fun but a little scary at the same time!

  David, Shane and Jason enjoyed jumping into the waves and riding the occasional one into the beach. If the guys liked it, Dad loved it. He kept going out, getting splashed around, and tossed in the waves like a wet towel in a front-loading washing machine. At one point he got stuck right where the wave was about to crash. I could tell he just sat there and thought &#8220;oh no, here it comes!&#8221; and he got shot down the beach like a bowling ball right into Rita and my legs. We thought we might have to pull him up from the waves, but he just popped right up and said &#8220;that was some ride!&#8221;

  Now we&#8217;re back by the pool, with much calmer water.  Time has flown by again. Already our trip has wound down and we go back to the real world tomorrow.

We are lucky indeed.
