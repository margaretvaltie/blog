We&#8217;re in another small village off of our original itinerary.  Ohrid is a small  city/ village on Lake Ohrid in eastern Macedonia.  The 8-9 hour bus rides (via the capital, Skopie) were very worth the full day of travel just for the views.  Like our drive through Bulgaria, Macedonia is very beautiful with rolling hills that give way to enormous hills and mountains.  Our bus from Skopie to Ohrid built the excitement by playing local music- it&#8217;s an upbeat mix of what sounds like Indian music sung and performed by a Mexican band.

We made a friend across the aisle from us on the way into Skopie. He was a Bulgarian man who spoke English, so the bus driver put him in charge of handing our passports back out to us as we went through boarded patrol.  He had to immediately re-collect them as we entered Macedonia to all get stamped.  Since I have a newer passport, I&#8217;m very excited to get stamps on this trip while Jacob has exotic, older stamps from Prague, Portugal, Bermuda, and South Korea.  Of course, on the way out of Bulgaria the guard randomly chose Jacob&#8217;s passport to stamp but passed me over.  Both sets of stamps were yet again works of stamping art- Jacob now has 2 pages of 5+ stamps in 4 spots.

Once we got into Ohrid, we took a cab to our guesthouse.  The hostel in Bucharest suggested this place and arranged it for us, which is lucky for us because it is very crowed this weekend.  Our room looks over the lake and &#8220;the most famous club in the city&#8221;, which is cool until we want to sleep.

Today we walked around a bit to find a suitable &#8216;beach&#8217; to sit on. We walked past the beach near us because it was small and rocky and hiked up the hill toward the other beaches.  We came across the Church of St. John at Kaneo, which overlooks the lake and the city.  We decided only to find an equally small rocky beach with crowds, a loud bar, and boats tied to the shore.

We walked back (giving ourselves 1 hour after eating), and went to the laid-back, locals beach.  Jacob got in immediately while I lathered on the suntan lotion, allowing an adequate Mike Halstead- length of time for it to soak in.  While Jacob was in the water, a Macedonian man struck up a conversation with him.  It turns out he does defense contracting work for an American company in Afghanistan, and he spoke English relatively well.  We talked in the seaweed-filled water for a while and then realized we&#8217;d spread our blankets in the same area.  After about an hour or so, he invited us to get coffee or a beer with him, his wife, and his cute 2 1/2 year-old son.  She listened and tired to follow along as we talked about American culture, Macedonian history, and our trip and occasionally translated our comments to her.  We had a very pleasant talk, and we wished him a good rest of his leave from the desert as we parted ways.

For dinner we walked to the &#8216;center&#8217; of the little town, which is filled with shops, restaurants, and vendors selling beniet/doughnuts, grilled corn, the ubiquitous ice cream stands, and jewelery.  Even as we call family and email at 10pm, the streets are packed with people enjoying the cool evening.  Tomorrow we hope the weekend crowds will go down, and we plan to visit the Tsar&#8217;s fortress, a few of the 13 churches, and of course spend more time at the beach.
