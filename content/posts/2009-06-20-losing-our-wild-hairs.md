Friday afternoon Jacob and I flew to Riga, Latvia.  Our orginal plans were to go to Estonia via bus or train, but all the local travelers advised us to stay in Riga and skip Tallinn.  Since it was around dinner time and we found a free hostel booking desk in the airport, we decided to try Riga.  We found the [Naughty Squirrel][1]/ the Argonaut hostel in the heart of Old Town. We are actually staying in an apartment run by the hostel, not the dorm-style rooms but we do have acess to the social public rooms and a mini bar area.

Our first night, Friday, we discovered the daily activity was a pub crawl. We signed up and met some Dutch guys also staying in the hostel and going on the crawl.  We met for drinks and shared a liter of vodka before heading out to bars, and the party clearly started stong.  I was the only girl on the tour other than our tour guide&#8217;s girlfriend and co-guide.  Since I had the honor of being a girl, I got a large beer mug full of a bottle worth of champagne while the boys got large pints of beer.  We took shots of local vodka with cinemon- it was actually very nice. The bars were crowded, but fun.  I was disappointed with one bar who did not have and refused to get Lady Gaga- the DJ argued that he had no reason to bother with her music, stangely.  Poor desicion, sir. He missed out on a future reunion of all my friends coming to Riga.

Today Jacob signed up for the daily excusion- he shot Kalishnakofs in a former Soviet nuclear bunker underground.  He and the Dutch men enjoyed themselves with shotguns, glocks and the AKs.  Jacob &#8216;won&#8217; the shooting match. Go figure, the American can shoot best.

I opted to walk around the city and I stumbled on a very interesting market.  It&#8217;s apparently the largest market in the area (Baltic coast? ) and it sold plastic bags, cherries, every sausage ever made, cheeses, dolls, used shoes, and more.  The guide books warned to beware Russia pickpockets, but I felt pretty safe.  I was rather lost though, and only bought fizzy water (mistakenly), bananas, and gum.  Whoo. It cost about 2 Lats, or $4.

Latvians are a funny people- they love shoes. Every woman wearns high heels or at least flats that click on the cobblestones, regardless of the strange fashions they wear above the ankel.  I&#8217;ve seen so many mullets it&#8217;s not funny.  Latvians are all about Pipy Longstocking leggins, modern architecture, ankle socks with all types of shoes, scarves, full winter coats in warm weather, and fresh flowers.
