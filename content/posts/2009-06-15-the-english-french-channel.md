Our crossing to France was quite interesting, to say the least.

To start the day, we stowed our bags in the b&b and took a train up to Stonehenge. As soon as we got off the train, there was a tour bus that offered to bring us to the sites, let us cut the line, and bring us back to the station after. It might have been overpriced, but it was convenient. We got to Stonehenge, got about halfway round the ancient structure just as it began to rain. Oh, English weather.  We stayed for the remainder of the audio tour, but skipped the stops at the other outdoor sites and downtown Salisbury. It did clear up while we ate pie (as in chicken and beef pot pie) in a pub, then it drizzled again.

We took the train back to Southampton, picked up the bags and hopped on another train to Pourtsmith. We arrived at the sacred hour when English cities close down (5pm) and the tourist info center suggested we could go see a movie. We stored our bags in the cimema manager&#8217;s office, and saw Star Treck. The Brits loved Scottie.

At 11pm, we took a night ferry from Pourtsmith to Caen, France. All the cabins were full, so we booked 2 reclining chairs that didn&#8217;t go as far back as the cinema seats. We were also delighted to find out that we shared the room with 1/2 of the Wales rugby team, who were all in the bar on the top deck. Jacob and I alternated sleeping across the seats and the floor, and the team can back at 4am with banjos, horns, and singing Elton John songs. Delightful.

We arrived very early in the port, took a bus to Caen, then a train to Bayeux and called around for b&bs. We finally found one near the outside of town, run by a French tour guide and his wife, Isabella.  She kicked us out until &#8220;midi&#8221; until the room was ready and we walked around the old city and went to the Bayeux Tapestry.  I was shocked to find out that French and history teachers lied to me and William the Conquor&#8217;s queen did not actually hand sew the thing.

Isabella arranged a D-Day tour for us the next day, and we went on the American/ Canadian tour to Point D&#8217;Hoc, Omaha Beach, Juno Beach, and the American and Canadian cemeteries.  It was very impressive, but Jacob (the D-Day expert and Band of Brothers fan) was not happy with the quality of information. I was very amazed with the sheer size of the beaches and the distances between the landing points on the familiar maps. Omaha was naturally impressive without the history- even more so when you think that American soldiers ran across 300 yards (over 3 football fields) of beach before getting to the shore full of Germans.

The next day Jacob found another tour that covered more history and went to Band of Brothers sites. He enjoyed his second full day much more.  My parents were also in Normandie, and I met up with them Saturday morning while Jacob toured.  That night we went out with a family from our b&b from DC, and we ended up staying out drinking and talking with Catherine, the daughter and a recent grad of the family.

The next day, we spent all day traveling from Bayeux to Bourdeaux via train. We waited until 2pm for our first train ( note to self, no more traveling on a Sunday when trains don&#8217;t run as frequently).  We stopped over in Rennes and Nantes before getting into Bordeaux at 11pm.  We checked into a hotel across from the station and crashed immediately.
