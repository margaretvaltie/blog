My friend from high school, Lauren Gray, is doing a Semester at Sea as part of her super-senior year at WKU.  One of her first stops is the wonderful port city of Accra!

Her boat landed Wednesday morning, and she’s been exploring parts of the city and met with a local NGO organization. Wednesday morning she had a meeting with the creators of Global Mamas, a fare-wage marketplace for women to sell their crafts at values that will let them make profits and therefore sustain their families and trades.  She went on an overnight trip somewhere over the last day and a half, and we plan to meet up tonight before dinnertime. I’ve got all sorts of plans for her trip to Pokuase.  Hayford is opening up an extra room for her to sleep in, and Jacob and I plan to tour around the new Obroni. I hope to feed her foufou, take her to Eric’s, and have her meet the Chief.

Other than spending tonight and most of tomorrow with Lauren, we also have plans to journey back to the Accra Mall.  Anne mentioned that she missed dancing, and would like to go to a place to dance in Ghana. Luckily, we know, PK, the dj at the restaurant/ club in the Accra Mall. Jacob also hopes to catch the movie District 9 while it’s in the theatre in the mall before our night of dancing.  PK tells us the best night to go out is Friday, since most good Ghanaians go to church early and all day on Sundays.

It promises to be a weekend full of fun, and hopefully it will be a great last weekend in Ghana for Anne.  Sadly she leaves us to go back to teaching in Germany on Tuesday.
