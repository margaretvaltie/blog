After our wonderful diving trip Jacob and I flew from the Great Barrier Reef to Melbourne in the south of Australia.  It was a great change to find familiar faces-  Jacob’s cousin Paul and his wife Lauren offered to let us stay with them for 4 nights. We flew in on Friday and were met by the wonderful Lauren, who gave us a ride from the airport.  We made a quick stop at one of their markets to get some steaks, chicken, fruits and vegetables for the weekend. Lauren explained that Melbourne especially has a great market culture- instead of supermarkets and prepackaged foods, there are several large and ethnic markets with fresh products and hawkers competing for the lowest prices.  It reminded me a bit of a farmers’ market combined with the Seattle fish market.

Back at their house Jacob and I unpacked a bit and met the 3 girls- Nancy, Maxie and baby Alex.  Without any hesitation Nancy made sure we were worthwhile and interrogated us about our favorite dinosaurs.   We passed the test apparently.  Lauren and their nanny-in-training fed the girls, gave them baths, and put them to bed just as Paul got home from work.  Paul put the girls to bed and caught up with us as he lit the grill for the steaks.  At one point he paused and said, “Man, it’s great to you’re your American accents!”

Saturday Paul was working on a behind the scenes project for the Australia premiere of HBO show The Pacific. Luckily for us he worked out 2 seats for Jacob and me while he filmed the theater and interviewed guests and veterans. It was a great experience to see the show in a theater, surrounded by the cast and crew.  The premiere showed episodes 1 and 3 to introduce the show and highlight the episode about the marines in Melbourne.  After the show Jacob and I wandered around a bit while Paul and his crew finished up and caught up with Pacific coworkers.  We found him in the crowd and followed the group of crew to a little bar around the corner.  In a little while our hunger got the best of us and Paul took us to one of his favorite restaurants near his house.

Sunday was a very eventful day.  We went to the Dragon Boat Chinese restaurant for yum cha with Paul and Lauren’s family.  I had never been to a yum cha before- it was a bit like a buffet, except the waiters brought dished around from carts rather than us going up to a buffet.  Paul, Jacob and I beat Lauren and the girls by a few minutes and met Lauren’s mom, sister Liz, dad, brother Joe, and Joe’s girlfriend.  Once almost everyone arrived the food came quickly and we all jumped in to the dumplings, Chinese broccoli, and many other wonderful things.  Lauren’s sister Liz exchanged travel information with us since she had traveled around Vietnam and was hoping to go to New Orleans someday.   Lauren’s dad took a quick group photo of us outside the restaurant and we split ways for the afternoon.

Next on our agenda was an Australian Rules Football game.  Paul described it as the Chicago Cubs vs the New York Yankees.  The Western Bulldogs, Paul’s team, were red and blue and had been underdogs while the Magpies were black and white stripes and had the more obnoxious fans.  Outside the stadium we met up with Paul’s friend James who was unfortunately a Magpies fan, but he only trash talked a little.  Jacob and I sat in the middle while Paul and James explained the game to us from opposite ends. I think we figured out the rules of the game around the middle of the 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter, just when the Bulldogs started to fall behind.

The Bulldogs lost- a great motivation to start the season, Paul claims- so we went out to mourn and celebrate.  James led us into the Greek part of town where there had been a festival all day.  We feasted on slovakis  and toured a few different bars around the area for the night.

Paul had Monday off of work, so we all lazed around and entertained the girls for most of the day.  To add to the list of new experiences, I had a crash course in babysitting.  At one point while Paul and Lauren were out 2 year-old Maxie came walking down the hall towards us with her pants down. I took the educated guess that she needed to pee, so I walked with her into the bathroom.  She matter-of-factly went about her business while I was a bit confused about the procedure.  I asked her what I should do and she just gave me a look of “you’re kidding, right?” as she attempted to pull up her pants again.  Silly grownups!   Jacob had a similar encounter with Nancy, who was filling up her backpack to go on a “river expedition” in the backyard.  She described the monsters and crocodiles she would see and Jacob asked her if she needed an adult to make sure they wouldn’t get her.  She gave him a look and said “It’s not real. I’m just playing in the backyard, Jacob.”  Touché, Nancy.

Tuesday we said our goodbyes and Lauren took us back to the airport.  We flew back to Sydney for the night before flying on to Singapore.  We only had 2 goals for our stopover in Sydney- dumplings and books.  We went back to the amazing steamed dumpling restaurant we’d found on our first trip to Sydney then went off in search of books.  We’ve been reading tons of books lately with all of our flights, so we decided to stock up on books while we could in an English-speaking country.
