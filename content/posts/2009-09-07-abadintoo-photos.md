Saturday night was the opposite of the day-  we wore bight clothes and celebrated new life as Nimo and Princess officially named their son.  In the photos are:

1. The actual ceremony- Nimo (in the middle) and other leaders pour out libations to honor the child and the dead. Immediatly afterwards they shot off guns to symbolize how strong the boy will become.  
2. Nimo, the proud father  
3. Jacob and me  
4. Dancing the night away with another guest
