Sunday I finished my second 1/2 marathon in Chicago!  
I was very lucky and very excited to PR with a time under 2(hr)20(min). I was writing an email to my coach, Deanna, but decided it should become a blog post too. Here&#8217;s my race recap:

<img class="alignleft" title="Chi 1/2 logo" src="http://www.chicagohalfmarathon.com/Assets/Chicago+Half+Marathon+Digital+Assets/Logo2012.jpg" alt="Chi 1/2 logo" width="255" height="109" /> **The Plan**

I felt very good going in with a race plan for warm-ups, what to wear, intervals etc. I even made a Google spreadsheet with my estimated timing, intervals and distance. It helped to think about that as I got to the mile markers along the route. My plan: 8 or so 15-minute intervals of running with 1 minute walk breaks after each interval. The first mile or so is always a mess with theÂ crowdedÂ start line, but then my plan was to do 2-5 intervals at my very comfortable running pace, in heart rate (HR) zone 3. Then I could bump up to low Z4, which would be a more challenging but good race pace. If all goes well, by mile 10 (of the 13.1) I could go even faster and even sprint the last .1miles. This is how I trained and did long runs, so I felt good with this plan, but secretly hoped I would feel awesome and speed up &#8211; the point is to start slow and steady then speed up at the end.

**Disaster Strikes**

About 2 min into the race my stupid Heart Rate Monitor (watch and chest strap) stopped reading. For miles 1-6 it said my HR was 31. I would be dead if my real HR was 31. For perspective, my resting HR is mid-70s and my &#8216;threshold&#8217; of running hard but not sprinting is 185. So a HR of 31 mid-race isÂ ridiculous!

I tried to fix it but didn&#8217;t want to fool with it and get distracted, so I just stuck with consistent runners and what I thought was mid-Z3 for intervals 2-4. I probably pushed into low Z4 too soon, in intervals 5-7. By mile 10 I started to push it to what felt like threshold (but was probably too much) and all the sudden I felt like I was getting too tired too fast.

The course was interesting &#8211; we ran on Lake Shore Drive for most of the &#8220;out and back&#8221; course. We started by zigging though the Hyde Park neighborhood, then went onto the closed-off road. It was coolÂ persecutive, and fun to see fans sitting on the divider and standing of the bridges overhead cheering. The random cheer groups were great &#8211; people with signs, a guy dressed up as the &#8220;More Cowbell&#8221; SNL skit, cheerleaders, and a few drum corps. I was feeling really good at the turnaround, about mile 7-8, which is where I really struggled in my first 1/2 Marathon.

I was feeling good and wanted to up the effort, so I did push more after mile 8. I probably went into mid- to upper Z4, which was too much effort with so much race left. Â I mentally swore off drinking and fried food for the rest of my life. By mile 13 and thought my legs might turn toÂ puttyÂ when I saw the 3/4 mile left sign. From 3/4 mile left to the 1/2 mile left sign felt like a whole mile. I made the final turn (thinking &#8220;where is the stupid finish line already!!&#8221;) I would have sprinted to the end but I physically couldn&#8217;t go faster!

**Completed &#8211; a new PR**

I turned the corner, knowing I was blowing my estimated finish time, as well as my super &#8216;reach&#8217; goal out of the water. I went in thinking I would like to beat my slow first race, but only by 10-12 minutes. I secretly hoped to run it under 2:20, maybe 2:15. I crossed the finish line at 2:13:38 &#8211; two minutes less than I dreamed!

The most frustrating thing about pushing so hard at the end is coming to a complete stop after the finish line. I know I need to walk for a while to cool down and notÂ collapseÂ into a quivering banana-clutching idiot. I did manage to grab a medal, banana, face towel, and a granola bar before I could extract myself from the mass of runners/supporters/voluteers/photographers that all stand in that tiny space.

I found Angel pretty quickly &#8211; after some vague geographical locations, &#8220;no, the slightly talker white tent to the other left of the beer tent&#8221; &#8211; and we grabbed our free Lou Malnati&#8217;s pizza slices ðŸ™‚ It was 9:30am but that pizza tasted great!

**Next**!

The only thing about 1/2 marathons is that people assume the next thing is a full. Like 13.1 miles is just a warm up for a &#8216;real race.&#8217; Like hell! I&#8217;m perfectly content in running for under 3 hours per run &#8211; marathon training can take up to 5hr each run at the peak of training! &#8211; so I&#8217;m focused on more 1/2 marathons and mid-long distance.

Next up, I&#8217;ll be cheering on my running teammates and friends at the BoA Chicago Marathon. I got some great ideas for inspiring and funny posters from this race.

For running/ races in my future, I really want to run the &#8220;[Race of the Dead][1]&#8221; 5K on Nov 3 and the [Hot Chocolate][2] 15K on Nov 4. The real challenge is that they&#8217;re 1 day apart&#8230; After that I think I&#8217;ll go back with my running/coaching group to train for a spring 1/2 marathon. Hopefully it will be a destination race somewhere warm!
