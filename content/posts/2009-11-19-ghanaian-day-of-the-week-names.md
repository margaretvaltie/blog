The other night we were talking to Hayford about life in Ghana. He reminisced about being a street seller before there were plastic sachets of pure water, and he would carry a bucket of water on his head and pour it out into cups for people in cars.  He demonstrated with our shower bucket, and he looked just like he was doing the “I’m a little teapot” dance.  He talked about life before electricity, which is funny since he’s only 24.  He also talked about how the older members of his tribe carved their names on their arms so if someone ever got lost or murdered their bodies would be returned to the tribe for burial.  Pretty interesting stuff.

One of the things I like the most is the day of the week names.  Ghanaians’ first names are based on what day of the week a person is born on.  I’m a Yaa, born on a Thursday.  Jacob, Charlie, BossMan, and Forson are Kwakus, born on Wednesday.  Hayford is a Kofi, and he explained that some have meanings.  We’ve noticed that when we tell Ghanaians what day of the week we are, they all just say “ohh, I see” without any explanation.  Even Yao couldn’t really explain what our Thursday names mean.  Hayford remembered some- and I put them in a chart below.

It’s fun to introduce ourselves by our Ghanaian names.  One of our favourite cab drivers, Yao, prefers to talk to me and loves when I call him.  He still laughs when I call and say “this is Yaa calling for Yao”.
