Saturday night Jacob and I headed south to the tip of Laos and a widening in the Mekong River.  From Vang Viang to Vientiene we had a 3 hour van ride, about an hour for dinner at the bus station and a 12 hour overnight bus to Pakxe and a 4 hour shuttle to Si Phan Don, where we caught a boat to a tiny island.  It was one of the nicest overnight sleeper buses I’ve ever been on with a small dinner, blankets, pillows and full, lay-down beds.

Once we got to the town by the riverside we caught a boat to the island of Don Det.  In the greater area of Si Phan Don (4,000 Islands) the Mekong River has formed thousands of little islands along the boarder between Laos and Cambodia.  Once on the island we searched for a simple bungalow over the river and a big lunch.  We stopped at an authentic looking Lao café, and after a wonderful meal we decided to stay there since the owner was so outgoing and friendly.  “Papa” of Mama Mon and Papa’s showed us to the simple, tiny bungalow with a porch and hammock overlooking the river and then arranged a tour to see dolphins and the waterfall on the other island.

Apparently this area of the Mekong River is home to some of the 300-400 remaining freshwater dolphins in the world.  Jacob and I each hopped on the back of a motorbike and cruised around our little island and across and old railroad bridge to the bigger island where we transferred to a small boat.  Our host went with us across the water to the sandy shore of Cambodia, which was just a small jut of land and a little wooden hut.  Our host left us and the boat driver for an hour while he went to go visit a friend in Cambodia.  Sitting in the little hut by the river we were sure that we wouldn’t get to spot and dolphins, but within about 20 minutes we saw the blue-grey fins coming up for air all along the L-shaped curve around us.   I think our boat driver was perplexed by us because we shouted and yelled each time we saw the dolphins resurface.

Back on the motorbikes on Laos soil, our host took us to what is supposedly the biggest waterfall in South East Asia.  The water rushing over the giant rocks was impressive now but apparently in the rainy season the waters rise so far it is essentially just some rapids.   I can’t believe there’s no other great waterfall in the entire region, but I believe our host.

The next morning we got up early for a boat pick-up to take us to our next bus adventure- a multiple leg trip over the Cambodian border, past the capital and west to Siem Reap.  We drove for about 30 minutes until we came to the border where we had to pay to leave Laos, pay to get checked for H1N1, pay to get our visas and pay again to get an entry stamp.  We guessed that we paid about $7 in unofficial fees but I got them back by not paying the 2,000 kip (40 cents) to use their bathroom.

From the border we got another bus for most of the day and stopped for lunch and dinner where the people headed to Siem Reap had to get out and wait for our next bus.  In about 2 hours we finally got our last bus and hoped to get in by midnight.  Our bus guide, who was mainly just trying to sell us a hotel in Siem Reap, told us not to worry about getting in.  He assured us we would get to town by 10pm (on a 4 hour drive) and told us we can sleep in the bus.  “Oh it’s a sleeper bus?” we all perked up a bit, but he actually just meant that we were allowed to sleep on the bus when we close our eyes!

We staggered into Siem Reap just after midnight and followed our friend Reg to the Siem Reap Hostel.  In the morning we woke up to discover it’s one of the nicest hostels we’ve seen in a long time- there’s a swimming pool, restaurant, movies and huge air-conditioned rooms.  We might change our plans to stay more than 2 nights now.
