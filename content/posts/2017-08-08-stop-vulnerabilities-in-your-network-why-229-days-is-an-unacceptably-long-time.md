Cloud28+ members can rethink network security to make attacks less possible and less profitable for hackers.

**Minimizing an overlooked attack vector: interior networks**

The most frightening part of big-story data breaches has been how long it takes to detect malicious traffic or a network breach. In Sony’s case it was never detected; the hackers posted threatening messages and leaked the data publicly. The Experian/T-Mobile breach lasted over 2 years.

Mandiant’s Threat Report found the average time for a company to detect breaches is 229 days; 4% slower than reported the year before. 69% learned of the breach from an outside entity, such as law enforcement. Ponemon reports that it takes IT security teams in financial services an average of 98 days to detect intrusion, and an average of 197 days in retail.

**These trends beg tw0 questions:**

How can organizations minimize the their attack vectors while benefitting from cloud?  
Can network security measures make network intrusion significantly less fruitful for hackers?  
With greater network sprawl, we should assume internal networks are as dangerous as public internet.

**So how can we protect applications, servers, systems inside a network? Segmentation.**

Most applications (ie, the set of servers that perform a business function) in a network can be made “invisible” to each other (from a network perspective). Even with only basic interior firewall rules, an organization can protect themselves from a Sony-style data exploit.

Segmenting by application or function, some call it micro-segmentation, can achieve greater security and granular control by making cloud or data center resources invisible and undetectable to each other.

Cloud28+ users can build security into every aspect of application architecture. By assuming all networks are dangerous, teams can better secure critical data as it travels across networks or resides in shared environments. By using segmentation at the application level, critical application can limit their network interactions to only essential traffic. Most app servers should be invisible to each other as well, allowing app teams to focus app needs, not blanket policies.
