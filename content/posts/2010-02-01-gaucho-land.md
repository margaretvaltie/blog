From San Ignacio we took a long bus ride to Salta, Argentina. After hearing so much about the wonders of Argentinian busses, it was exciting to finally be on one. They showed movies, the seats were a bit larger, we had trays that could attach to the seats, and dinner included. The pair in front of us were Canadian so we chatted a little and joked about how late they served our dinner.

Once in Salta we checked in to our hostel, the Road Runner, and decided to walk around the little town and not waste another part of a day after a long night bus. We went to the MAAM museum, a high-altitude archeology museum dedicated to the sacred offerings of Incas in the Andes. They have 3 perfectly preserved children who were left at the peak as offerings to the gods along with toys, clothes, and gifts much like how mummies were left with other items. The high altitude and freezing temperature preserved them, including the color or their clothes and their hair and skin. One child rotates on display at a time, along with many of their gifts and toys.

The rest of the afternoon we walked around the town and looked at the few ornate churches. By 8.30pm it was an acceptable dinner time and we went to a highly recommended restaurant near the nice central square.

Sunday Jacob and I went on a horseback riding adventure with some local gauchos. Our tour technically began at 10am, but we got picked up at 10.45, then drove about 30 minutes to get other guests and beyond the town to the ranch. Once we got there our driver, David, joked that he left the gate open the night before and all the horses got out. For about the next hour or so we waited under the porch for David and Gonzalez to gather horses, saddle them, and get organized. Pierre and Vanessa, the Canadians from the bus were also in our tour with us.  Finally, we all got on our own horses and set off on a little path following Gonzalez.

I rode horses when I was much younger, but I quit because I didn´t get the horse I wanted and I prefered just riding and not doing jumps and going to shows. I was excited to be back in the saddle, literally.  We rode off on narrow grassy trails and through huge swarms of butterflies.  On the trail Jacob´s horse was a bit willful and sat down in a small pool of water and nipped at my horse when we were trying to get a photo together on our horses. Then when Jacob was trying to get past me and my horse his  
horse just reached out and bit the crap out of my leg. It was one of  
those things where I was screaming before I realized who was screaming  
and why. Everyone stopped at my  scream and our little gaucho guide came and hit Jacob´s horse and checked if I was ok. I wasn´t  
bleeding, but it left a big bruise instantly right by the fleshy part  
of my knee. Gonzalez told me that he´s been bitten many times, even  
kicked, so I took that as &#8220;you´ll be fine&#8221;.



We continued on the trail, through knee-high plants and bushes, up a steep trail, wide car-sized trails, and through a few little streams. At one point we came across the ranch´s cows and effectively hearded them into the bushes. After the climb and about an hour of riding along narrow trails Gonzalez got us all to canter up a stretch of road and again on the way back to the ranch house. The whole time 3 dogs from the ranch followed us and guided us at times.

Back at the ranch I lifted my pants to check on my leg. It was weirdly numb when I dismounted, and I realized it had swollen to look like a second knee! Even now there are teeth marks surrounded by a dark blue and purple bruise. Other people in our group took pictures and wondered at the horror. Gonzalez did get me a bag of ice and told me in 2-3 days I would be fine.

Once we all got back and off the horses we sat down at a table David had set out and the 2 gauchos set to grilling the tons and tons of meat. We feasted on vegetables and steaks for what seemed like hours. Afterwards there was a lasso contest and David bet us that if we couldn´t lasso a post in 3 tries he could lasso us as we ran past him. I did not participate, but it was hilarious watching everyone try to lasso the post and then get caught around the middle by David´s lasso.

We all thought we signed up for the 1/2 day morning tour (ending at 2pm) but it was getting close to 8pm. Finally we seemed to be wrapping things up and we headed back to town. We had such a great time together in our group that the 10 of us, Gonzalez, and David went into the square to have a few drinks and eat dinner together. No one really felt like eating after that feast, but we talked and joked for hours more. Most everyone had scratches, wet shoes, horse bites, or some other injuries as well as sunburns. We were all exhausted but it was a great day of life as a gaucho.
