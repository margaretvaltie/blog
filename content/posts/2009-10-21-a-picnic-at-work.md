Today at work Jacob and I brought peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  The peanut butter really disgusts Charles and he’s pretty funny while we make them after breakfast.  Along the way to work we bought plantain chips- they’re baked and are quite tasty.   At work we walked out on the balcony to find ladies walking by selling papayas and pineapples from large trays on their heads.  We called them over, picked out a good looking papaya (or pawpaw) and the lady peals it and cuts it for us.  For fruit coming from someone’s head, the ladies are always very careful to clean their knives and never touch the peeled fruit.  They masterfully peel it in quick little knife cuts, then they slice the fruit into the ubiquitous black bags that cover Ghana.

Jacob also thought of a genious plan to make sure to find the fruit ladies and water sellers as they walk past.  At the end of our balcony is the office of the man who owns the building. There are always people around, but I’m not sure if they ever do anything.  Men are usually sitting in plastic chairs outside the office, and Jacob asked them to come get him if a water kid or fruit lady walks by.  Now we get water and fruit delivered to us whenever we want!
