The day after our 4th of July celebrations we continued our American style vacation in Slovakia.  Dan, Jacob and I went to a local lake where locals go to cool off.  It was a nice, cheap little park area with very cold water- maybe mountain run-off from the Slovakian mountains.  It was a short tram ride outside the city, so we just packed up some bathing suits and our hostel towels and bought some sausages, corn on the cob, and popcorn from little vendors.  It was great for people watching.

Once we got back to the city in the afternoon, we met an Irish, Andy and Catherine, couple  in our hostel and went out to dinner at the Slovakia Pub (again).  The portions were enormous! I got &#8216;shepards&#8217; risoto&#8217; and Jacob ordered some cabbage soup and mini dumplings with sausage and cheese.

Over dinner we shared funny travel stories. The Irish couple started with a story about how they ran to catch a train in Germany, were told the wrong direction, and then arrived just as the train pulled away from the station.  They didn&#8217;t have a hostel booked and couldn&#8217;t get in since they were leaving again at 5am on the next train and ended up sleeping in a train station.  Jacob and I commiserated because we&#8217;d also missed a train, but we slept in and got another day in town.

Dan&#8217;s story might have won though- He arrived in a city in the south of France when the regional wind from the Alps was especially strong, and he walked from the train station to the information booth on the next block.  The man told him to try a hostel on the other side from the station. Dan cursed his even longer walk back to the station, and found the man at the window didn&#8217;t speak any English.  After some time of talking and asking for anything with a bed, another man attempted to translate.  Apparently, this was a juvenile detention center! Dan was probably the first person who asked for, and offered to pay for, a night in jevie.
