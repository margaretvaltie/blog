There are so many excellent posts on how and why to have codes of conduct already out there. Like <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2010/12/07/6-reasons-event-organizers-should-adopt-the-conference-anti-harassment-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/conference-anti-harassment-campaigns-do-work-three-existence-proofs-from-sff-atheismskepticism-and-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/a-code-of-conduct-is-not-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

I want the events I help organize to be as inclusive as possible, and a safe place for everyone to come, learn, and interact &#8211; women as well as minorities, students, people with disabilities, LGBTQ, and more.

I had a lady come up to me after one of the more interactive events this year and thanked me for the way we ran the event and encouraged participation for both questions and answers from the group. But, after the same event I had a guy ask me if he could get the emails of all the attendees to &#8220;follow up&#8221; afterwards. Womp womp.

So, I created my own code of conduct to put in writing how I feel that everyone should act at every event (and in normal life!) for anti-harassment, inclusivity, photo/video recording etiquette, and a place to say we refuse to share members&#8217; information.

Here&#8217;s my bulked up code of conduct:

*****

The [group] is audience fueled and vendor-neutral. The group is dedicated to being open, welcoming, thought-provoking, and free of anyone trying to sell something or recruit members. The group is an open community to learn and share knowledge &#8211; attendees are encouraged to share thoughts, questions, and experiences in loosely structured discussions.

**Because of our interactive and open environment, we will not not tolerate harassment in any form, will not share attendee personal data, and will not distribute or sell attendee information to anyone.**  
**Anti-harassment Policy**  
[group] is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be asked to leave or blocked from future events at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately for help.

**Privacy Policy:**  
We do not, under any circumstances, share personal data about our attendees. Registration is open to all and limited to what attendees enter when registering.  We absolutely will not sell or distribute attendee lists for sales purposes. We will not share emails, phone numbers, company affiliation, employment status, or any other personal information with other attendees, companies or third parties. If you would prefer to register without providing some of the information on the signup form, please contact an organizer.

**Inclusion Policy:**  
[group] is a straightforward after work meetup group, and sponsors only cover the costs of hosting, drinks and pizzas (and usually the organizers have to pitch in). While we do not have have standard arrangements for those who are hearing impaired, visually impaired, gender-neutral, or disabled, we can however make arrangements to accommodate and include all. If you have any concerns or special considerations, please contact the organizers before the next event.

**Recording/Social Media Policy:**  
[group] is a place to share information, not only with other participants, but also with those who may not be able to attend. Sessions are, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media and photographed. _Please assume all speakers and participants are sharing their own thoughts and opinions, not those of their employers._ If you do not want your picture taken, your words to be recorded or for either photographs or words to be attributed to you, please let other attendees know. As a courtesy, please always ask prior to creating sound or video recordings of any event. Please be thoughtful and respectful with your photographs, recording, and sharing.

Each event can decide to adopt different rules at the beginning of the session (e.g., completely private, or no attribution without asking first) as long as all attendees are informed.

**Contact Details:**

Organizer Email and Phone  
Building Director of Security information  
Local taxi information

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events. Be excellent to each other.
