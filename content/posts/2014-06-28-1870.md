I wish I had a dollar for every &#8220;it&#8217;s been a while but I promise to write more&#8221; blog posts I&#8217;ve seen. There&#8217;s always a good reason for not blogging for extended periods of time&#8230; here&#8217;s mine:

### A Change of Focus

I started this blog in 2007 to write more. I was interning at the time and was a bit under-utilized. Then after another long gap, I changed focus to make it a travel blog.

I blogged consistently for the 18 or so months I spent traveling the world. It was intended as a &#8216;I&#8217;m alive, and now in X&#8217; for family and friends. Apparently my parents never read it.

Now I&#8217;ve been repatriated for nearly 5 years and no huge travels since.

Blogging, social media, and my focus have all changed dramatically since I started. If I could do it again, I&#8217;d have a Tumblr blog like my friend Jen, who just went on <a href="http://jeibeyglows.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an enviable and awesome adventure</a>. I&#8217;m doing more &#8220;micro blogging&#8221; as in I post interesting content to <a href="https://twitter.com/MargieWalker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and Pinterest and read tons of articles on <a href="getpocket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a>. I have only been doingÂ some long-form content for <a href="http://blog.cohesiveft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who pay me</a>.

### From Henceforth&#8230;

I will try to post useful things from my new life of social media management, blogging, fledgling tech marketer, and aspiring athlete. Content may vary. Void where prohibited. Not valid in Alaska.
