After my last [book report on The Manager’s Path](/2020-03-23-book-report-the-managers-path/), I realized I’d taken good notes on another work-ish book I’ve ready in 2019. Team of Teams was also from that list of books recommended at a DevOpsDays open spaces discussion. 

I was very pleasantly surprisesed by how much I liked Team of Teams and enjoyed reading it. The only real cons I had were the examples tend to be all military or defense-adjacent organizations - like NASA or airspace companies - and the book itself was a bit longer than it needed to be. If it was a 45minute Ted Talk I would recommend everyone watch it and skip the book. 

Once I got into the book’s thesis I saw the benefits everywhere: when organizations move from “command and control” to teams with “shared consciousness and empowered execution” the entire organization benefits. A team of teams is the ideal way to make informed decisions from the ground up and the best way to be agile and effective. Teams should feel empowered to make the decisions about things that impact them - for me I can see teams doing software deployments should have input into the CI/CD tools and metrics they use to define success or teams with huge technical debt should be able to choose how and what they tackle first. At the top of the chain, managers should get more feedback more frequently to move to projects or systems that work, like the decision to bail on a software purchase that just isn’t working for teams.

### Antipatterns and Effective Teams

Two great examples drive the difference between “command and control” and “team of teams” were the United flight 173 and NASA in the 1960s. In United Flight 173, the pilot was the commander and everyone reported up to him to make a final decision. The chain worked well. The crew worked together, shared information, and communicated. But the flight crashed because they ran out of fuel. The decisions were made by 1 person, the captain, and it slowed reaction time and ultimately used up the fuel. 
Opposite of that was NASA from the 1960s missions: the small teams inside NASA shared knowledge organization-wide because they were a newer organization and simply did not have enough time to be hierarchical under their time crunch to make it to to the moon. Their method was inefficient with their time and money, but their “systems thinking” was very productive. 

But a good thing to note is that teams of teams requires work to maintain. As bureaucracy took hold at NASA in the 90s they became more efficient but far less productive. NASA slide into silos and their “faster, better, cheaper” model was both expensive and failure-prone. 

### Empowering Team Success

Teams need a few key components to succeed: shared consciousness, trust, and empowerment. 
The authors call the concept “shared consciousness” or a centralized way for bringing people together. It’s a bit like “psychological safety” concept where people need to have trust, communication, and relationships in order to experiment and be safe to fail.  The other component is actually being empowered to act, or structuring teams so that authority is decentralized at the edge of organizations and not only at the top. 
Takeaways for forming teams of teams:
* Empower people *after* creating shared consciousness
* Empowered execution without shared consciousness is dangerous. Think of the. 2008/9 financial crisis where those empowered to make massive economic impacts didn’t feel the effects directly.
* shared consciousness without empowered execution will just frustrate people
*  Networks are what speeds empowerment. Adding more computers doesn’t make the group better. Networking computers together actually helps

### Systems Thinking and the Prisoner’s Dilemma

The book cites the experiments in 1980 by Robert Axelrod. He got a robot to play the Prisoners dilemma scenarios in “tit for tat”model (the bot followed what other player did and didn’t ‘hold a grudge’). He found the best outcome was to choose cooperation by default. 

In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the best outcome is when prisoners are incentivized to collaborate. Both sides must know the outcomes AND be able to choose AND trust the other players. Teams of teams must have all 3 components to build a culture of trust and “shared consciousness”. In the technology and software industries I see this translating into trust or psychological safety, cross-functional teams, and strong relationships across an organization. 

### Other good nuggets

Education vs training. Medical school is education, where future doctors get a whole systems  overview and complete understanding of the human body, disease and pharmacology. First aid for medics and EMS is training. People learn solutions to common, known problems such as how to deal with asthma attacks or when to spot a stroke but not the complexity to fully treat the patient.
Complicated vs complex. Complicated means something with difficulty. Think of a machine with parts that is difficult but not impossible to operate and fix. Complex is unexpected. Think of a future outcome from many inputs that are interconnected and unexpected. Bike is complicated with parts, predicting a pool cue break or weather patterns is complex. 

Order can emerge from the bottom up. Joint cognition is the concept of piecing together information from many sources with a holistic view. In a colony of ants, all ants working together. The queen isn’t actually a ruler. Ants pass info back and forth to the central part of the colony where the queen lives.
