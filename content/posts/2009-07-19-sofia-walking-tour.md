Saturday morning we went on a walking tour set up through the hostel. We should have seen the warning signs- the 2 of us consisted of 2/3 of the group and our guide was 15 minutes late.  The hostel people told us he&#8217;s normally late, so they tell him to come 30 minutes before they tell guests to meet up, yet he was still late for us.   It ended up being a walking tour for zombies.

Our guide walked incredibly slowly- maybe it was his way of stretching the tour to last the whole hour.  As we left the hostel we all stopped to wait for him to lead, talk or do something but every time we stopped or slowed down he would do the same and ask &#8220;we go?&#8221; or &#8220;proceed?&#8221;  By the end of the tour he stopped asking, sadly because we would have had different answers. He also bumped into or stepped on Jacob about 8 times. It&#8217;s not like Jacob was hard to see or darting around to be bumped into so much&#8230;

He was clearly an architecture professor, because he focused on every large or important building we came upon and listed the architects who built it, when it was begun and completed, and the styles of each. After a few buildings of this type of information I lost interest.  About halfway through I realized he hadn&#8217;t mentioned anything about a person, the city&#8217;s history, or told us a story that made the city unique or personal.  We did walk by the interesting sights in Sofia (there were only a few)- the former palace, the Soviet square and administrative buildings, the printing house, the monument to the liberating Tsar, theatres, and several churches.

Within a few blocks there are 2 old Orthodox cathedrals, a mosque, and a synagogue. They were all built around the same time and have existed peacefully since.  The newer Orthodox cathedral is apparently the largest in the world and all the frescoes and sculptures inside were very impressive.   After the cathedral we broke the news to our guide that we didn&#8217;t want to continue to the university or library across the square, and we went to lunch with the other American on our tour.  We found a brewery/ restaurant on the street by the churches, and had another nice, meat-filled lunch.

That afternoon we spent in the hostel reading, talking to new friends, and planning the next steps of our trip.  We booked an early morning bus to Skopie, Macedonia en route to the lake town of Ohrid.  Since we had an early morning trip and all-day drive we decided to go to a movie. We successfully found Ice Age (even in 3D), but despite the hostel&#8217;s assurances it turned out to be dubbed over in Bulgarian. We opted to see _Public Enemies_ instead- we recommend it!
