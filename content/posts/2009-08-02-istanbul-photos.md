We toured Istanbul&#8217;s historic sights on foot-  
The Grand Bazaar, Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque

And from 2 trips on the river-  
The largest mosque in Â Istanbul- Beyazit Camii, the Sultan&#8217;s Palaces, and historic and expensive homes from the Bosphorous River that separates Europe from Asia.
