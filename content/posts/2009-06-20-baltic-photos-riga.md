Sadly, I didn&#8217;t take many photos in Riga.  The freedom monument was built in the 1920s to celebrate independance, right before the Russians and Germans invaded. Now 2 solders constantly guard the statue to protect Lativian freedom.  
Also in Riga is St. Peter&#8217;s curch with a great view of the city from the upper towers.  In the first areal photo are old hangars that are now the wild market, near the train station and the river. On the other side are older red-roofed buildings and new Art Nuveau buildings.
