After I felt bad early in the week and Jacob and I created a good deal of work for ourselves at work, we decided to take a weekend off.  We didn’t go to work with Hayford and Charlie, and instead called up our trusty cab driver Yao.  Yao especially likes me since we’re both born on Thursday (men are called Yao, women are called Yaa).  He drove us the 6 hours it took from Accra, past Cape Coast and Takoradi and finally to the little beach.  Butre beach is next to a little fishing village, and our hotel, <a href="http://www.ghanaspirit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghana Spirit</a>, is woefully unmarked.  Thankfully Jacob and I had been there before with Anne, but we still struggled to find the right way from the main road to the beach.  It was a bit comical looking back- we had to stop to ask for directions several times within feet of the beach.

At Ghana Spirit we were warmly welcomed back by the staff – Emmanuel, Joshua, John, Malcolm and John. Jacob and I were the only guests the whole weekend and apparently there hadn’t been any guests all month.  We were very happy to enjoy one of the biggest reasons we came back- the food! Emmanuel makes amazing chocolate and banana pancakes, chicken and avocado salads, tuna and sweet corn sandwiches, beef burgers, and they even walked to Buswa to get us bacon for BLTs. Last time we were at Ghana Spirit they were out of bacon, and Jacob joked that we came back just to get BLTs.  On Sunday, John walked the hour each way to the next big town to get 6 delicious pieces of bacon.



The beach was wonderful again, and very relaxing.  Jacob and I read and took advantage of their book selection.  We brought back _Song of Solomon_ and _Jarhead ,_ which we borrowed from them last time.  I finished and left _A Most Wanted Man_ , read _Bridge on the River Kowi_ , and picked up _Catch-22._ Jacob read _Kite Runner_ and picked up _the World According to Clarkson_ , a book of articles by the British comedian and the host of the TV show Top Gear.    We also had fun fighting the strong but shallow waves.  The long beach caused the waves to crash about 10 feet before the shore but the water was very strong and had quite an undertow.  It was funny to stand in knee-deep water, get knocked over by a wave, and then to get sucked back out in ankle-deep water.

By Monday we were ready to have some adventure on our way back to Accra.  Yao came back out from Accra, and drove us to the Kakum National Park outside of Cape Coast.  The main attraction was the canopy walk- a hanging rope and wooden walkway strung between 8 giant trees above the tree level.  It was definitely a unique experience to look far down at the tops of trees and look out for miles at the horizon.  It was not a real nature experience, though, since our group and the people that work in the part made so much noise that any sensible animals would never have come near us.  Luckily we had a monkey encounter the weekend before and we plan to go to Mole National Park to see some big animals.  We did make friends with 2 older nuns from St. Louis randomly.

Next, Yao drove us to the Hans Cottage Botel (they really spell it botel, don’t ask me why).  According to the Bradt guide- the book we called the “book of lies” in the Volta region- we could feed live crocodiles and take pictures.  As we drove in we had to pay a “gate fee” and I had a bad feeling that it was just a tourist trap.  The actual feeding was a bit underwhelming.  We walked through the busy restaurant, and we were told to ask for Mary.  Mary was also the waitress, and after a few minutes she ushered us behind the open air restaurant with a plate of raw chicken meat.  We hadn’t noticed on our way in, but there was a crocodile.  She took the chicken, strung it on a stick and held it out for the croc to chomp.  He wasn’t the most lively croc, but he snapped up the pieces quickly.  That was it for the feeding, and Mary told us we could walk around behind it to take pictures if we wanted.  The restaurant full of older German tourists watched as Jacob and then I posed behind the croc’s tail.   Jacob smiled well, but by the time I went around to squat next to his tail I noticed his head slowly turning towards me.  “What am I doing!?” I thought and decided to move away before he decided to turn all the way around to see what was touching his tail.    We wanted to get our 4 GHC worth, and Jacob fed the rest of the chicken on a stick to the croc.  Yao and the Germans looked on, and probably thought we were crazy.

We found a great chop bar for lunch in Cape Coast, then we set off for Pokuase.  Once we got home we met Sarah, the new VPWA volunteer. She’s a fellow American from New York.  She will be working in an orphanage for 2 weeks. Jacob and I are excited to have another American for the Ghanaian Thanksgiving celebration we’re planning.   We got another volunteer overnight too.  We’ve yet to meet her but our little apartment should be full of fun now!
