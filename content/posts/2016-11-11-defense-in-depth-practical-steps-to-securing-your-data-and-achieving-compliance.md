## Defense in depth: practical steps to securing your data and achieving compliance

[Originally published in Cloud28+][1]

As more enterprises use cloud, organizations cannot build one physical perimeter to protect it all. With network sprawl, we should assume internal networks are as dangerous as public internet.

So how can Cloud28+ users protect data inside a network? Segmentation. Most applications can be made “invisible” to each other from a network perspective. Even with only basic firewall rules, organizations can protect themselves from a Sony-style exploit.

Most enterprises focus on perimeter defenses and overlook internal network security. The weaknesses of the perimeter-based approach were on display in the TalkTalk, Teso Bank, UK banks, and Sony over the last few years.

Today&#8217;s complex and distributed networks create a more porous data center perimeter, making it easy to use corporations’ networks against them. Nearly 85 percent of insider attacks or “privilege misuse” attacks used the target enterprises’ corporate local area network (LAN), according to a 2014 Verizon security report.

“With recent high profile, broad-reaching and sophisticated penetrations of firms such as JP Morgan Chase and Sony, it’s increasingly obvious that simple perimeter level network defenses are insufficient,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. “Combined with the fact that every portion of technical infrastructure is a target, application level security with encrypted segmentation is a must have.”

Perimeter-based security approaches have not evolved to meet the modern application-focused enterprise. Hardware and virtualization layer defenses give far too much access to core mission-critical controls. Teams are forced to write overly permissive controls to accommodate overlapping use cases. The weaknesses of the perimeter-based approach are on display in the east/west attacks on Sony, Target, and Home Depot exploits where hackers gained access to the perimeter, then ransacked the internal networks with minimal resistance.

**What can modern enterprises do? A “defense in depth&#8221; approach to security at the network layer.**

Enterprises must strengthen existing core networking hardware and virtualization layer security with added application security. Just as the physical segmentation at the core hardware layer and logical segmentation at the virtualization layer, application layer security provides “application segmentation.” This presentation will examine how an defense in depth at the application layer can stop the next Sony attack.

In data centres, physical network isolation is not practical, and logical segmentation can be very difficult without using evolved networking approaches. As data centers became wholly virtualized and blur the line between data center and private cloud, we can finally add and control logical segmentation at the virtualization layer.

**This “Application Segmentation” provides the most comprehensive security model available today.**

You can apply application segmentation defense in depth using Cohesive Networks’ VNS3:turret. VNS3:turret creates a cryptographically unique micro-perimeter around each application topology. By segregating each application, the inner rings of security can eliminate east-west vulnerability within a network.

Within the VNS3:turret mesh, users can set their own access rules, firewall settings, and other security policies specifically for that application cluster. With flexible and interoperable components, VNS3:turret allows users to add in compatibility with existing networking devices and open-source capabilities such as network intrusion detection (NIDS), proxy, caching, and load balancing.

From the Cloud28+ Cloud of Cloud Catalogue you can find deployment options and resources for getting started.

With added security and connectivity from VNS3:turret, you can deploy an encrypted, clustered software-only micro-perimeter to secure mission critical business systems in public/private cloud. This “Application Segmentation” provides the most comprehensive application security model available today. VNS3:turrent is a secure, redundant network combined with dataflow and compliance tools to fit your use case.
