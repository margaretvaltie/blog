  My purse got stolen on a bus to Lima.  It had my passport, credit cards, cash, Jacob&#8217;s camera, my guidebook, and my driver&#8217;s license. I was so attached to that bag and it was full of useful things right down to the hand sanitizer and copies of my travel documents.

  I was reading a book and watching out the window so no one would steal our backpacks from under the bus. Someone must have grabbed it from between my feet and ran off before the bus got going again. I noticed on the way to the next town, but we decided to just go on to Lima.  We got in around 7pm, after the embassy closed, and headed to the &#8220;tourist police&#8221; to file a report.  The officers there were really helpful and we watched a local soccer game with the captain while we waited.  After about an hour we had a super detailed report- including the time of the bus, what seats we sat in, all the stolen items and their value, and my description.  It was around 8.30pm when we left the station so we went across the street to eat at a Chinese restaurant between the national police building and the tourist police.  We decided it was the safest restaurant in Lima.

  Today we spent the morning at the US Embassy getting a temporary passport.  I can use it for a month and hopefully get a full passport when we have a longer time in a capital city.  With my police report, copies of my lost passport, 2 photos, and some US cash I got my temporary passport in about an hour.  In the meantime Jacob and I walked around outside the embassy and found an appropriately American Dunkin Doughnuts shop.  We thought about staying around for McDonalds to serve lunch, but we went back to the city instead.

Back in the historic district, we took a tour of the San Francisco monastery and the catacombs beneath. The tickets included a guided tour in English, which was great.   The churches and buildings were constructed in the 1500 to 1600s and there were several places where earthquakes had destroyed parts of walls and ceilings to reveal layers of murals, frescos or paint underneath.   The catacombs were the most interesting by far- over 25,000 people were probably buried there.

Jacob and I walked around a bit more and found a little spot for lunch.  Like most wonderfully cheap places in Peru, we got an appetizer and a second for 7 sols or about $4.  I got the ceveche (my latest obsession), Jacob got the house soup and we both got the mysterious beef and rice second.

Revived, we walked around the central area and the main cathedral.  Central Lima seems like it is filled with history, but not worth seeing after the sun goes down.  When we checked in late last night our hotel receptionist took out a map and first pointed out areas we should &#8220;no go there!&#8221;  We laughed, but as we left the tourist police station last night the officer told us &#8220;don&#8217;t talk to strange people&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t talk to strangers- got it.

Our brief time in Lima is almost over.  In a few hours we are catching a flight to Tombes, in the north of Peru.  With any luck we might even cross the border into Ecuador tonight and head towards Guayaquil and Quito in the next few days.
