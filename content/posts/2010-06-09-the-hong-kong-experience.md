In our long stopover from the continental Southeast Asia to South Africa, we discovered there really aren&#8217;t too many &#8220;sights&#8221; in Hong Kong.  This suited us just fine since Jacob and I were looking forward to a break and a sort of segway between Asia and Africa. It gave us the wonderful luxury of fully unpacking and repacking our bags, which is very rare. I discovered a few things I&#8217;d squirreled away deep in the bottom of my backpack.

I think we got a good feel for the city in our 6 days.  We rode the MTR subway, the streetcar-like trams, and the wonderfully nice public busses.  In the airport on arrival we bought &#8220;octopus cards&#8221; that allow us to pre-pay for all the public transport and some convenience stores like 7-11. All we have to do is wave the card over the scanner at the end of our ride or before we get on the subway. The public transportation made it incredibly easy to live in the city and get around quickly.

Once we got over the initial shock of all the towering buildings, lights and Chinese signs it was very easy to navigate through the city.  On our first night we got a bit turned around with the elevated walkways and interconnected shopping malls, but we managed to find our new favorite dumpling chain Din Tai Fung. 

We spent a few days shopping in the mainland peninsula side of HK, called Kawloon.  It seemed like things were a bit cheaper than on the actual Hong Kong island, which was full of designer labels and high-rise malls.  We shopped for some warmer wear once we suddenly re-realized that in a few days we would be going to South Africa&#8217;s winter. While it won&#8217;t be cold per se, it will be chillier than the summer gear we&#8217;ve been wearing in the extreme heat of Vietnam and Southeast Asia.  I thought the super air conditioning of Hong Kong was a nice adjustment for us.

One of the &#8216;typical Hong Kong&#8217; things we did was afternoon tea at a nice hotel. We arrived a little early, so we walked around the ubiquitous adjoining mall until 3.30pm when we could get into the buffet.  I think we got our money worth with the tea and the buffet. We ate enough of their sushi rolls, smoked salmon and salads for lunch and dinner for both of us!

Two nights ago we ended our city wanderings early to go to the Hong Kong Races. There is a horseracing track in the middle of the island- a part of town called Happy Valley, maybe because of all the gambling.  It was only 10HK to get in and it was an interesting sight to see the mix of people watching, socializing and betting on the horses. There was a slight rainy mist, so I think the glitzy gave way to rain coats and most people huddled under the overhang or stayed indoors near the betting terminals.

In the next 2 days we hope to go to Macau and Hong Kong Disney. It should be exciting!
