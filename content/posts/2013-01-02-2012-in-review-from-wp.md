The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2012 annual report for my blog.

[<img alt="" src="http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2012-emailteaser.png" width="100%" />][1]

Here&#8217;s an excerpt:

> The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner can carry about 250 passengers. This blog was viewed about **1,600** times in 2012. If it were a Dreamliner, it would take about 6 trips to carry that many people.
