Like the many travel blogs before mine, I&#8217;m also offering my packing list to the world. After the summer in Eastern Europe and 4 months in Ghana, I have a few strange but helpful additions to my usual list. Fabreeze, suction cup hooks, and multipurpose soap, to name a few. I also tried to limit all the clothes from Europe and Ghana, since there&#8217;s always something I end up not wearing or lugging around. I definiatley had too many shoes before and not enough multi-purpose clothes. So here is my final list of the contents of my backpack:

2 books (The Good Earth and The Long March), 2 guidebooks and a Spanish phrasebook, a Ghana flag  
Shirts- 3 tank tops, 6 tees, Ghana jersey  
Bottoms- 2 pants, shorts, skirt/dress, leggings, running shorts, euro pants  
Raincoat  
Shoes- chacos, my &#8216;uglys&#8217; (gray closed flats), flips  
Misc- jewlery, emergency vodka, intl cell phone, sleep sack, travel towel, lighter, rubber bands, safety pins, fabreeze, all purpose washing soap, hairspray, vitamins and medicines, toiletries and razors, laundry bag, earplugs, iPod and awesome noise-canceling headphones, camera and corresponding cords.  
And of course- passport, ittenerary, travel insurance, cash, contacts and solution, bug spray and sunscreen. 

I am currently en route to Rio via both Chicago and Miami. Jacob is flying directly from NYC, and we will meet in 90 degree Brazil heat. It is strange to travel light again after lugging my African Vera Bradly around the country for the last month.  
By 11pm I will be off the continent again and restore hopes of the Saints winning again. Ever since I&#8217;ve been back they have lost, so now that we&#8217;re on the road again there can be a Black and Gold Superbowl!
