_&#8220;If an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it. Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another&#8221;  
&#8220;Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.&#8221;_ &#8211; Milton Friedman

Every Wendesday, the company meets with the [IAM union][1] to talk about upcomming issues at Cessna. Lately it&#8217;s been pretty tame and predictiable since everyone is getting ready for negotioations, which start Monday. But usually, both operations leadership and HR labor relations meet with the local union plant chair and business reps. Company management in the past was a bit more secretive and mistrusting of union leaders, but now management tells the union leaders what is going on recently with company policies, schedule changes, etc that could affect bargining unit employees. Most of the topics discussed aren&#8217;t actually things the union can change. The company tells the union things like the new airplanes are going to be built with certain engines, the Kansas law on firearms changed and will affect company policies, etc. Union leaders usually raise hell over everything, despite the fact that they don&#8217;t have authority to dictate things like what company makes the future airplane&#8217;s engines. I&#8217;m sure if they could be on the company team that picks them, they&#8217;d pick engines that come from American, unionized shops rather than quality or reasonably priced engines. Therefore, the union reps work for the union and represent union interests rather than company intersts- it&#8217;s only logical that they&#8217;d fight everything.

After the meeting, all the company people stayed after to talk about plans for negotiations. I got to talk about my project for labor relations that will compair Cessna to the Detroit 3: we currently dominate the biz jet market, but if we get complacent, we could loose out to some of our rapidly growing competitors. As we sat there, the HR director for labor relations mused about our particular union leadership. Apparently none of the state-level union leaders even has a college degree.

Also, he talked about unions in general and what he thinks they should be doing. Unlike some management people I&#8217;ve met who think all unions are pointless and evil, the HR labor director knows why unions are still around and somewhat necessary. He did mention they&#8217;re going about it all wrong, but he was very objective about it. In his eyes, unions have and will probably always exists to ensure job security, benefits, and pensions. If companies were inherently evil and only cared about bottom lines (as union spin says) they would cut all extra jobs, wages, benefits, and pensions while unions must preserve them. Our union hasn&#8217;t experienced a strike since 1976, and there haven&#8217;t been any &#8220;big fights&#8221; since then. The 20% of employees who like to complain and are &#8220;deadbeats&#8221; ruin opportunities of the union to represent the other 80%. If only the union could push aside the 20% who want to work less and get paid more, the union could face issues that are important to the 80% such as job rotations, job security, shift hours, etc. This way union leadership could attract many more people and be much more representative of the employee.

Right now I think about 20-30% of the eligable employees here are in the union, while nationally maybe 15% of workers are unionized. What this union needs, in his eyes, is &#8220;more enlightened leadership&#8221;- as in better traditionally educated, [more willing to work with management][2], and more atune to employees. The company provides union leaders with offices in the plant and pays the salaries of the leaders (part of the &#8220;good faith&#8221; clause of the union laws and contracts), yet they spend very little time in the plant. The company leader, the business rep, is notorious for blowing off meetings with management and union members alike. I would be mad if I were in the union and even more furrious if I was in the barganing unit but not a member.

If these leaders wanted to really help their members rather than play politics and harp on similar issues every negotiation year, they should invest some time in keeping union membership up, actually listening to employees, focus on keeping jobs in Wichita, and keeping Cessna&#8217;s competitive edge. All of these things are dulled by the union&#8217;s current setup. The IAM at least is run like any other political bureaucracy: the people in leadership roles got there by a popular vote and they stay there by pandering to those who elected them- union members. While they technically represent all workers in the bargaining unit, union leaders logically work much harder for dues-paying/ voting members through grievances, arbitrations, proposals in contract negotiations and so on. Right now, the union is focusing only on a benefits program the company won&#8217;t change or force employees to enroll in, more money, and bigger pensions. While these are important issues they&#8217;re not what I consider the most important. The company can&#8217;t move employees from one section to the other for more than 20 minutes without the union complaining about job code violations even if the employee would rather be doing other jobs. The company can&#8217;t let employees decide what shift they want to work because the union rigged the last 3 votes. The company can&#8217;t move a segment of opporations into another location without union approval, which takes months. The current grievance process does not happen in a timely fashion, which leaves employees in limbo and without work until a final decision is made. How does this kind of stubborn opposition help the company that is trying to help its employees?

Unions were very important. That is completely true. Unions paved the way for the child labor laws, fair wages, the creation of benefits, a 40 hour work-week, and workers rights to representation and compensation. Yet I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been very good change since strikes looked like this:

Ayn Rand wrote, &#8220;Economic power is exercised by means of a positive, by offering men a reward, an incentive, a payment, a value; political power is exercised by means of a negative, by the threat of punishment, injury, imprisonment, destruction. The businessman&#8217;s tool is values; the bureaucrat&#8217;s tool is fear.&#8221; As soon as I read this I thought of the fervor that surrounds contract negotiations right now. Union leadership is set to indue fears about strikes, wage cuts, layoffs, and company power over employees. The company is doing very well right now and behind production schedule so there is no reason it would cut wages or lay people off.

On the other hand, I&#8217;ve been working on several little projects aimed at the union and employees alike to inform them of competitors and emerging trends in the industry. In about 3 years Embraer will enter our end of the business jet market, bringing 37 years of aviation experience and an average of $4.15/hr. Cessna simply can&#8217;t compete on wages alone so the company is looking into other ways to remain above the competition- which requires major cooperation from the union leaders and members. Plus, these are not the 1930s and the company is not trying to hide anything from its workers, it is paying well over the minimum wages ($13.48/hr for the most inexerienced people vs the new $7.25/hr Federal minimum wage), there are health programs open to salaried employees that the union won&#8217;t allow its members to participate in, and I find the overall culture at Cessna to be very amicable.
