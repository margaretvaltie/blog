Sunday afternoon Jacob and I went to the pool at the Shangri-La resort, near the more touristy and wealthy part of Accra.  Hayford dropped us off after he got out of church and drove to Tema while we swam and basked.  We enjoyed the cold water and sun for 2 hours.

On our bumpy ride back my head began hurting, and continued until Monday.  Even at work I felt a bit of pain every time I moved quickly or bent down.  At Victoria’s food stand we asked for sandwiches, but we each got a bowl of a mixture of chicken, cabbage, onions, and white beans to go with our own loaf of butter bread.  After lunch I felt worse- I was nauseous, my head still hurt, and i was chilled even outside.  I consented to go home around 1pm, and I lay motionless in bed until Jacob came back around 4pm.   I felt sick to my stomach that evening and Jacob started feeling equally as bad a little bit after me.

The next 2 days we both felt terrible and called in sick to work.  We were in agony, dreading the smell of food.  I finally had the brilliant idea to call our friend Forson, who runs the Health Focus newspaper project we work with. Conveniently, he’s a pharmacist.  Tuesday night be brought us stomach pills and rehydrating salts.  Slowly we’ve recovered and are managing to eat small amounts of food.  Today we revisited our Chinese restaurant from last week to have more soup and noodles.  Our stomachs are still weak, but for some reason I’m convinced that if I can just eat some foufou and drink coconut water I will be cured.
