Mykonos and Santorini had marvelous sunsets- I took more pictures of sunsets on the islands than in other countries total! It was hard to take a bad picture with such a great subject.

Some of the best shots- the sun setting on a tiny whitewashed Greek church, Mykonos windmills in the afterglow, crowds gathering to aplaude the Santroini sunset, and the sunsets themselves.
