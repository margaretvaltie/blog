_06 JUN 2019 | AWS Community Heroes_ 

At the heart of the global AWS community are the builders and influencers whose passion for AWS leads them to actively share their technical know-how with others. The most prominent of these AWS community leaders are recognized as AWS Heroes. Heroes regularly share their extensive AWS knowledge online via blogs, social media, and open source contributions, and in person by speaking at industry conferences and running workshops or AWS-focused User Groups.

Today we are thrilled to introduce the latest cohort of AWS Heroes:
