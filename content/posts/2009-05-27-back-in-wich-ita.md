After a long 14 hours of driving, Mom and I made it back to Wichita, KS from New Orleans, LA yesterday/today at 12am.  

I spend today unpacking, sorting, and repacking. I&#8217;m trying to plan everything I could need for both a fancy cruise on the Queen Mary and a budget hostel filled trek through Central Europe. My plan is to bring a small bag for the boat with my formal wear and some cool weather clothes (I&#8217;m guessing the Atlantic gets chilly) and stuff my mondo backpack with the bare essentials and light things. I&#8217;ve bought some nifty things online and at travel stores- my backpack and shoulder bag, Campsuds, ultralight towels, and a travel wallet. 

I leave the Pearl of the Prairie Friday day and head to NYC to meet up with Jacob and his brother, Chris. Saturday is Jacob&#8217;s graduation party with his mother and sister in the Berkshires, Mass. We come back to New York for the day and head to the boad around 3pm. We push off around 6pm- it&#8217;ll be my first time on a ship. Friday night or Sunday day I hope to catch my cousins in the Big Apple- Michael, James, and Megan. 

Off to sleep with more packing and planning for tomorrow.
