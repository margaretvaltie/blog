Results are in!

For the past 2 years I've asked the Chicago AWS user group for feedback. I am curious what's resonating with folks for topics, format, and communication. Before I just relied on people contacting me with ideas for talks (shocker: they usually want to talk about their own tools / services). Feedback was just a casual chat after an event, some good and some bad.

**Read the Comments**

I like to think I know a well designed survey; I did major in Consumer Behavior and Sociology after all! One of my favorite / most boring classes was a Marketing class that applied statistics and consumer sentiment. It was really dry stuff: surveys, scale, choice, data. But my professor knew it was dry and every other slide or so had a funny thing to explain his point. I'll always remember his explanation of <a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/survey-response-scales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how pointless scales can be in Likert surveys</a> &#8211; he linked to the clip of This Is Spinal Tap &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/4xgx4k83zzc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but these ones go to 11</a>!&#8221; Bless his nerdy heart.

Hopefully with a well designed survey I can bear to read the comments. Luckily, all positive this year. I also didn't have a free-form section for negative feedback either. :forehead-tap-meme:

**First question - how do you get your updates for the user group? **

Pretty clear &#8211; people still dig emails. Newsletters are having a moment too, apparently.

**What topics do you want to hear about?**

Back to survey nerdery &#8211; mean vs. mode. Mean = average Mode = most frequently answered. I wanted to see what most people thought, and gauge the level of enthusiasm. For example, some folks are pumped about IoT but not everyone is equally pumped. It's a solid middle-pack topic. Security is full of both passion and popularity. A perennial hot topic.

**Formats &#8211; choose your favorite**

Looks like people want to give back, hear from AWS speakers and get AWS updates and maybe win stuff. Some of you crazy people want to nominate your friends to speak, so I'm gonna make that happen with some website updates &#8211; muhahaha.

Got thoughts? Wanna give feedback more than 1 time a year? Eager to nominate speakers? There's always the <a href="http://chicagoaws.com/contact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact form on ChicagoAWS.com </a>
