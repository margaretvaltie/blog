Without much sleep after our night train, we signed up for the tour of the Rila Monestary- one of the most talked about sights in Bulgaria. Â Anything could have looked beautiful set against those glorious mountains, but the monestary itself was also impressive, well-kept, and had an air of awe.

We also went hiking (to our surprise) around the area, though a secret cave/ chapel, and along the river by the monestary.
