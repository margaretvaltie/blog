Tuesday we devoted the day to touring Auschwitz-Birkenau and the museums.Â  It was a few hours by hot bus, and we were worried that the bus wouldn&#8217;t make it!

The first and most lasting impression I had of the camps was the sheer size.Â  Birkenau, the second iteration of the camp, was enormous- it took us about 20-30 minutes to walk from the gates and the train entrance to the back where the memorial is now. The piles and piles of shoes, suitcases, glasses, hair, etc were overwhelming.Â  HeThe Nazis burned the gas chambers in Birkenau and the most of the sub camps on their retreat, but there was an original one in Auschwitz I.Â  Even the ruins at Birkenau were quieting.

On our way back we took another bus right before it rained. Jacob slept, but I enjoyed looking out the window at rural Poland.Â  I found the buildings and the people we drove by very interesting.Â  It seems like even new buildings, houses, shopping centers, etc are all made out of whatever materials are available.Â  Most houses were made of concrete, bricks, and tile and metal roofs.Â  I wish I could have somehow captured the sites of old scowling women standing in the driveways of the mix-and-match houses.Â Â  Once we were back in the city we were back to the streets filled with trams, kebab/ pizza shops and lody (ice cream stores literally on every corner).

Back at the hostel we looked at our travel plans, and decided to change our plans to go to Vienna (Wien) instead of Pargue.Â  It was a more direct route with fewer long train rides.Â  It&#8217;s starting to get dull sitting on trains, waiting for trains, and navigating new cities.Â  We are getting very good at card games, though Jacob does cheat at gin ðŸ˜‰
