  <p>
    This Wednesday, Sept 3rd, I organized the &#8220;<a href="http://cloudcamp.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unconference</a>&#8221; event CloudCamp Chicago.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Part of my role at CohesiveFT was to revive the free-form event in Chicago. Our London team has been going strong with the raucous after-work event since it started back in 2008. London&#8217;s events are part Meetup, part Parliament session with people jumping in to interrupt.

  <p>
    <strong>The &#8220;unconference&#8221;</strong><br />Usually, we pick technologies or cloud-related topics like security or hybrid clouds. This time we took some audience feedback and focused in on an industry and their data and security requirements. This CloudCamp event drew our usual crowd of technology pros, but we had a marked increase in attendees who work in both healthcare technology and healthcare in need of technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The &#8220;unconference&#8221; format had 4 short &#8220;lightning talks&#8221; followed by a lively &#8220;unpanel&#8221; debate session. The talks covered HIPAA, wearables, the caregiver side and elderly care from the lens of technology and compliance. After the talks, a few of the speakers and a few lucky audience members came back up to be on the unpanel. Many questions were directed at Dr. Griffin Myers, a doctor dealing with the headaches of both securing individual patient data while trying to use the population data to provide more tailored services.

    <span style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lightning Talks </strong><br />The first lightning talk, &#8220;Security </span>and Sanity in the HIPAA-Compliant Workplace&#8221; was by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alex-connor/1/213/9b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Connor</a>, Lead Architect at Crimson Care Management. Alex had great pointers for HIPAA basics, including encrpytion and working with providers to mitigate patient data risks. 


Following Alex, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMoschel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Moschel</a> of Factor 75 talked about wearables, biohackers and their impacts on healthcare. His talk&#8221;QS and Biohacking movements” featured how biohackers and quantified self-ers are using personal data to improve their personal outcomes. Mark even shared some of his own stats, from mood based on the day of the week to his irregular heartbeat reading from his iPhone-based EKG sensor. Later, Dr. Myers even mentioned he scanned the EKG data to check for a rare and potentially fatal sign of sudden cardiac arrest. Mark is safe, he assured us!

After the two technical guys, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/griffin-myers/6/246/947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Griffin Myers </a>took us in the opposite direction. His network of clinics, Oak Street Health, is not on the cutting edge of technology. Partly because they serve Medicare patients in Chicago, the clinics also just haven&#8217;t found the perfect fit of technology that works with patients, doctors, and the community without compromising patient privacy.

Dr. Myers had a completely different take on technology and patient care. His clinics founded on the idea that healthcare should no longer be &#8220;fee for service&#8221; (i.e. you get a hair cut and pay a fee, see a doctor and pay a copay for a visit) but rather a &#8220;fee for outcomes.&#8221; Part of their approach is to focus on patient populations, which makes data analysis challenging while also complying with HIPAA and patient privacy rules.

Also working with elderly patients, CareMerge&#8217;s VP of Client Experiences Carol Zindler took us through the journey from healthcare before technology to the potential silo-breaking opportunities today.

Carol began by commenting that healthcare data began, not to help doctors or patients, but to streamline billing and insurance. By changing how elderly patients interact with their families, doctors, and providers CareMerge is hoping to improve elderly care. The timing is just right, as well considering more than 10,000 Americans will turn 65 in the next 15 years!
