It&#8217;s a lazy Sunday in Southampton in the south of England. Jacob and I finally found decent computers and Internet in a cafe in the basement of a mall.  Finally, reasonable Internet prices and fast connections. On the boat it was incredibly slow and the computers didn&#8217;t have basic &#8216;cut&#8217; &#8216;paste&#8217; and &#8216;refresh&#8217; features, to make it extra irritating.

We woke up at 8 for breakfast, and got some good local travel advice from the other guests as we ate our baked beans, toast, ham-like bacon, and sausages (aka bangers).  They advised some day trips outside the city, mostly involving maritime museums.  They also informed us that the Chunnel is very expensive and might take us from London to Paris, which is out of the way in both directions for us.  After breakfast I went back to bed for another few hours. It was glorious. We&#8217;ve now discovered the other mall in town and a little outdoor market where we sampled olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and sweet ginger.

Southampton seems like a nice college town. It&#8217;s got 2 universities, many little parks and green spaces, bars and restaurants are plentiful, and is easily walkable. We decided to stay near our port of entry since we&#8217;ve both been to London, but we discovered we might be stretching for things to do. Brochures for activities include driving tours of expensive homes, working animal farms, and indoor water parks. I think we might take a few day trips to Stonehenge, Winchester, and maybe the beaches. We are also hoping to meet up with Chris and Abi, our QM2 friends, who will be back in town tomorrow. Our plan is to visit Portsmouth for the day and then take a ferry to the French shore, probably near Brittanny, rather than Chunnel.

Last night&#8217;s dinner ended up being our entertainment as well. I was dismayed at the lack of Mexican food at a restaurant named &#8216;Que Pasa&#8217;. I settled for the nachos, which apparently isn&#8217;t a tapas. Jacob had an interesting looking dish that was described as almost a lamb and veggie stew, but ended up being potatoes au gratin over lamb in gravy. He was in heaven.  
As we ate, the restaurant transformed into a bar as the menus were taken away, tables and chairs slowly disappeared, and the music changed to dance club hits (Brits love Beyonce, apparently). People flowed in and filled the bar by 9pm, so we stuck around for drinks- they had Strongbow on tap, oh boy! I guess it is normally a college bar, but since it&#8217;s the summer the crowd was a mix of young and old. It reminded me of the Boot over the summer, minus the orientation students sneaking in, or a combination of Bruno&#8217;s and Philips in New Orleans.  
The people watching was at an all-time high.  My personal favorite was a lady of around 40 who clearly couldn&#8217;t handle the Bacardi Breezes she was drinking, and she danced around and rubbed up on everyone who walked by.  Drunk Lady really brought the dancing out in people, and soon people began to dance on the elevated dance floor by the bar. I don&#8217;t think she stayed out much later.  
My other favorites of the night were a pair of guys who shared our table. They both had shaved heads and looked around mid- to late 20s, and were both on missions as soon as they set down their beers. One guy posted up at the video games of pub trivia and memory games while the other one set his drink down to grove and survey the crowd. He was clearly on the prowl, but I sadly did not get to see any of his powers of seduction at work.

After a few drinks we decided to walk around, and walked past several lines to get into other bars and dance clubs. We had had enough and walked back to the guesthouse. One of our housemates at breakfast today told us he&#8217;d witnessed the party scene as well, but sadly via people yelling and screaming outside his window late into the night.  \*No, mothers, it was not us. \*
