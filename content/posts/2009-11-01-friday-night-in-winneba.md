This week we swapped work days between Hayford and BossMan.  After my adventure with BossMan on Tuesday, we decided to go through with the idea to participate in a campus event.  We spent Wednesday with Hayford and Charlie, driving all over Accra and then finally settling down in the Amasaman office to work on the two grants we’re writing.   Rather than staying home Friday, we headed in to the office for a long day of promoting our company.

Friday morning BossMan, BossLady and another lady attended part of an international church meeting.  Apparently, it’s an organization of independent preachers that has branches all over West Africa and a few satellite locations where Ghanaians have migrated.  Our little meeting was about 20 preachers who represented their own churches.  The leader of the group gave us a whole 5 minutes to explain our company and field questions.  Thankfully, after we quickly listed our services – airline ticket reservations, tours, event planning and translations, and study abroad placements-  there were several questions that allowed us to further explain ourselves.  BossMan did most of the talking, but he hadn’t brought any cards, flyers, or contact information for them.  Jacob and I spent most of the meeting handing out a majority of our fancy cards.  I’m hoping we get a few more to bring back to the states.  The group was planning a big event in Accra later in November, and when they heard about our event planning and translation services they immediately offered us the spot.  Hopefully it works out.

Later that afternoon the men of the company, Big Jerry, Joe, Jacob and I piled into a van to drive back to Winneba.  We even brought Elvis- he’s the local representative for the European universities where we place students.  The student leader who invited us was a bit of a flake, but we came early prepared with our own projector.  The student had told us that there would be busses to shuttle students from the other 2 campuses and the program would start at exactly 5pm.  On our visit Tuesday, BossMan even asked him if he meant “Ghana time” or “real/ European time” 5pm.  At 5.30pm Friday he and most of the students were nowhere to be found.

Luckily the secretary of the student government found us and led us to the lecture hall where about 10 students were waiting for the program to start.   She said the promised shuttles were nowhere to be found and students were calling her from other campuses.  I suggested that we use our van to bring more students since neither the buses nor the other companies had come yet.  A few people went off with the van while Jacob, Elvis and I set up our projector and waited for students to arrive.   Finally, around 6.30pm the promised students showed up but we were still the only company out of 4 to arrive.  Instead of our assigned third, we started the program after the apparently mandatory drumming and dancing show and a prayer.

Jacob and I shared time going over the power point presentations about the company and specific study abroad programs.  I’m sure we talked too fast for the native Twi/ Fante speaking crowd, but the visuals helped.  I noticed one man in the front row wrote down almost everything we put on the screen!  After we finished we had BossMan and Elvis field all the questions- it seemed to help reduce any language issues we created.  When we finished our presentation, the next company arrived.  BossMan insisted we stay to watch them present, but he was bored within the first 5 minutes of the woman talking about short-term working stays in the US.  She had a good presentation, but it seemed that her program’s age maximums were around or below the average age of the audience. The older teaching students were not happy to hear the age maximums of 25 and 32!

By about 8.30pm the student leaders closed the program, right as the last company arrived.  They only had 5 minutes for their presentation, and they spent most of it handing out flyers.  After watching our ‘competition’ at the program, I felt much better about our presentation and our odds of attracting Winneba students.   BossMan was very excited, and he even gave a passionate speech about the greatness of our company on the van ride home.   Jacob and I joked around with our 2 younger co-workers in the back of the van. They taught us some funny phrases in Twi, and we joked that BossMan and Big Jerry were Timone and Pumba from the Lion King.  It is a hilarious sight to see the two friends walking next to each other- BossMan is tiny and energetic while Jerry is enormous and constantly laughing.

After such a great feeling at Winneba (despite the terribly unorganized student government president) I think we convinced BossMan to tour local universities and colleges to talk to students about study abroad placements.
