I got quoted in an article, &#8220;Experts Speak: Tips for Switching Your Content Management System.&#8221; Big thanks to the folks at [Website Magazine][1] for taking the time to interview me. And thanks for calling me an expert.

_But, just image &#8220;Joomla!&#8221; everywhere that I am quoted as &#8220;Drupal&#8221;&#8230; _

### Here is my section:

Margaret Walker, Marketing Specialist at CohesiveFT

CMS formerly used: Drupal

CMS currently being used: WordPress

WHAT DO YOU USE YOUR CMS FOR?  
Corporate website

WHAT LED TO THE DECISION TO CHANGE YOUR CMS?  
As part of a website redesign, we wanted to move to WordPress, for the ease of use, familiarity with WP, and the ecosystem of plug-ins to use WP as a website with forms, posts, scrolling images, event calendars, etc.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN USING YOUR CURRENT CMS AND DOES IT SOLVE ANY ISSUES THAT YOUR FORMER CMS DID NOT?  
We’ve been using WP a bit over a year. As mentioned above, WordPress has much more features for our website such as plugins for calendars, sliders, etc. and the ability to dig in and edit our own HTML or CSS. Drupal did have some functions, but it was challenging to navigate from the back-end. Now it’s much easier to whip up a landing page for a campaign, add and edit events or blog posts, and simply add in a new feature via plugins.

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE SWITCHING YOUR CMS? IF SO, WHAT?  
No, we were pretty set on using WordPress and it was going back to my comfort zone after using Drupal.

WHAT TIPS CAN YOU OFFER OTHER INTERNET PROFESSIONALS BEFORE THEY CHANGE THEIR CMS?  
If working with a website design firm, make sure they walk you through how they use the CMS. Although I was familiar with WordPress from previous projects, I still wasted a bit of time looking for things on the back-end. A quick level set with designers would have saved me so much time figuring it out on my own.
