Saturday Jacob and I were especially greatful for Professor Wilson’s Negotiations class.  We visited the National Cultural Centre, which is actually nothing like a museum and essentially a giant craft market.  One of the first vendors we found explained that the rules of the Centre are that sellers cannot harass shoppers or chase/ call after someone who was left their little shop area.  Other that that, it appeared that all other tactics were in full force.  One man followed along me, asking me to step into his shop, “no pressure! Please come by. No pressure. Look at these dresses and cloth. You will love this, look at that, try this on&#8230;”  I joked with him about the ‘no pressure’ part, but I don’t think he got my sarcasm.

We jumped right in to the cloth and clothing section of small stalls and eager sellers, but we quickly found ourselves in the wood carving crafts area.  Immediately, I saw a long narrow mask with traditional carvings and a lion face.  Being the lion lover I am, I had been hoping to find some type of mask/ lion carving.  Jacob bought a little elephant stool- it’s about 1 ½ foot by 1 foot, solid wood with bright beads covering its face and trunk.  We strolled further towards the beach and bought a few more carved items (it’s a secret! They might be your gift&#8230;)

After a few purchases, we decided to quickly get out of the wood section and headed back to the cloth, clothing, and jewellery stalls.  Jacob found a Hawaiian-style African print shirt while I bargained hard for a Ghanaian national team jersey.  I knew the jersey should be around GHC 8-10 but he started his offer at GHC 30! I told him how we’d bought a similar jersey in Osu for only GHC 10, and I pointed out the fact that it was clearly not a real Puma shirt.  Finally he came down to GHC 15, 14, 13 and then GHC 10.  He seemed very unhappy that I had gotten his price so low! But to balance my negotiating skills, I overpaid for some earrings further down the aisle.   After collecting our purchases and a soft travel bag to house Jacob’s elephant, we went to dinner at a restaurant we’d walked by a few weeks ago in Osu.  It turned out to be decent Chinese food and our 2 waiters seemed excited to actually patrons in their otherwise empty restaurant.

After dinner we headed to the Accra Mall to see a movie, which ended up running late/ on African time.
