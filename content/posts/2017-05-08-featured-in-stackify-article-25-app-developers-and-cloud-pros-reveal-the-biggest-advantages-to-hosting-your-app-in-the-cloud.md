## 25 App Developers and Cloud Pros Reveal the Biggest Advantages to Hosting Your App in the Cloud

More businesses are moving legacy applications to the cloud than ever before, but app developers face a unique set of circumstances. Sudden shifts in usage, for instance, can be catastrophic unless you’ve planned well in advance for such an increase — which is one reason load testing tools are so valuable, allowing you to test your app’s performance under a variety of simulated load conditions.

But if you’re hosting your app locally, your problems don’t end with an app that may not be able to handle the load. Can your server take care of it? Can you afford to pay for massive amounts of capacity that you may or may not need? These and other issues are one primary driver behind more developers turning to cloud hosting for their apps.

To learn more about the advantages app developers and organizations are reaping with cloud hosting, we asked a panel of app developers and cloud experts to answer this question:

“What are the biggest advantages to hosting your app in the cloud?”

**Cost** – Cloud shifts the costs of owning and maintaining data centers to on-demand pricing – it’s the difference between capital expenditures (or CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX). According to the CSC Cloud Usage Index, 82% of respondents saved money on their most recent cloud project.

**Speed** – Cheap, fast, and available compute resources let businesses quickly move past the old steps of developing, test, migrate, deploy and re-architect.

**Scale** – Amazon (or AWS) has 16 geographic regions around the world. Microsoft Azure is available in 30 regions and 8 in the works. These are pre-built points of presence for business looking to grow internationally.

**Productivity** – At the very basic level, cloud masks the technologically complex work of providing features, functions, and access to data (think email, Dropbox, Salesforce).

**Performance** – On-demand scalability, or elasticity lets organizations save on costs by paying for usage, not the maximum capacity needed.

**Reliability** – Cloud providers all offer Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of services, usually including Availability, Performance, Security / Privacy, Access to data, Portability of data and any Dispute mediation process.
