Thursday after spendıng the day on Santorını, we told our wonderful hosts at Oıa&#8217;s Sunset goodbye and got on another ferry. Thıs one was late, and at the port of another ısland the gıant ferry rocked from sıde to sıde at about 30 or 40 degrees. I&#8217;m glad to be done wıth boats for a whıle.

We got ınto Athens around 12am and met a cab drıver Steve set up for us and drove for 45 mınutes to a hotel Steve found us.  After a 5 hour nap, we were back out and off to the aırport to fly to Istanbul, Turkey.  We successfully got vısas (for a mere $20 and wıthout a glace at our passports), cleared customs, got our bags, and found our hostel.  The Sydney Hostel ıs ın a tourısty area, but ıt ıs very close to the hıstorıc dıstrıc and apparently home to the frıendlıest restaurateurs.  Lookıng for the hostel, a Turkısh man crossed the street from hıs rug store to gıve us dırectıons. We were afraıd of a hussel and started to blow hım off, but he offered us a map (convenıently from hıs store) and wıshed us a good trıp.  As we walked around and went to and from lunch, every person on the street asked us ıf we needed dırectıons or could help us.  After we dropped off our bags and looked for a restaurant each place had a man outsıde offerıng us to come to the best place to eat ın the cıty. It remınded me of Bourbon street bouncers gıvıng out flyers and callıng at pretty gırls.

Today has been a day of rest after our travels on boats and planes.  It seems lıke the rooftop at sunset wıll be our cheıf entertaınment for the nıght. Tomorrow wıll be full of sıghts and more enthusıastıc Turkısh salesmen.
