Our time in Normandy was almost exclusviely spent with D-Day tours. We visited Omaha beach, where the largest American attack came in, and Jumo beach where Canadians landed.  Jacob also visited Utah the next day.

The monuments are on Omaha beach, including one made of sand for the 65th anniversary of the landing.  The American cemetary was huge and very well done, with a large monument and rows and rows of graves. Teddy Roosevelt Jr and his older brother are burried there.
