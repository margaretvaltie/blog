  Now that work is so slow and uninspiring (and my evaluation as an &#8220;Achiever/Input/Intellection&#8221; by  <a href="http://sf2.strengthsfinder.com/" title="Strengths Finder">Strenghts Finder</a>, a Myers-Briggs type test of personal strengths), I have had more time to look into things that genuinely interest me. And now, for my latest obesssion:
</p>

  As a recreational reader of Time magazine, I barely noticed the photography, except in relation to interesting articles.  Since I Google everything, I also look at the little news features I added to my page (I still don&#8217;t know how I feel about <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2007/05/igoogle_how_about_gweb.html" title="iGoogle" rel="noopener noreferrer">iGoogle</a>)- which includes Time. My new favorite feature of theirs is the photo section. There are some very interesting bits, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1626519_1373664,00.html" title="few" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> caught my eye.

  This, in turn, got me thinking about some of the things we studied in my sociology class Research Analysis (which regretably showed up on my class schedules as &#8220;Anal,Research&#8221;). The light dawned when I was reading the blog of my sociological inspiritation and her latest post about <a href="http://www.visualsociology.org/about.html" title="Visual Sociology">Visual Sociology</a>.  This field of sociology was created &#8220;to promote the study, production, and use of visual images, data, and materials in teaching, research, and applied activities, and to foster the development and use of still photographs, film, video, and electronically transmitted images in sociology and other social sciences and related disciplines and applications.&#8221; In other words, what do your art/literature/communication styles say about you? In Research Analysis we studied survey responses varrying from the check-yes-or-no, to-what-extent-do-you-agree, and open-ended written reactions to photographs. As soon as our project was assigned, I immediately focused on how incredibly difficult it would be to somehow quantify written responses of over 100 surveys in some coherant analysis. As the course went on, Prof Brayfield taught us how to break down written sections into manageable sections and quantifyable groups. Yet despite all the standarized catigories and traditional approaches, the end analysis is heavily dependent on the researcher and his/her interpretation of what words are important and similar.

  Visual sociology, then, is that bit of researcher interpretation to the extreme. Two sociologists could look at the same group of data and come up with two entirely different analyses. My online investigations led me to 1) join the ASA and 2) order a sociology journal, and more importantly, 3) to the <a href="http://www.visualsociology.org/about.html" title="IVSA">Internation Visual Sociology Association</a>. Upon reading a bit more about VS on the IVSA site, ASA site, and other sites, I decided the idea wasn&#8217;t as crazy as I originally thought. Granted, the field of VS is much more vague and difficult to analyze than the statistics in the <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/ICPSR/SERIES/00028.xml" title="GSS">General Social Survey</a>, but I think there are other media that can describe society much better than the age/sex/race/opinion 1-5 style of survey.

This new devlopment in the wild world of sociology is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the positive:

  *  There is an infinity more subjects sociolgists/anthropologists can study.
  * New advances (like studying internet posts, text message language, etc) can keep sociology modern and appealing.
  * More people will become interested in sociology who previously thought of themselves only as filmakers, photographers, and internet users.
  * It is much easier to have assured results when you study the products of people, rather than people themselves since people might lie, be in a bad mood, or simply not understand the purpose of being studied.
  * Studying media can allow VS to be international and more approachable.

On the downside:

  * Acually getting clear results/analysis from objects is very difficult. You can&#8217;t ask it to better explain itself, come back in for a second interview under different circumstances, or compair it to a group similar to it.
  * It is now close to impossible to determine if someone is interested in telling an individual or group&#8217;s experience or actually writing a case-study [ethnography][1].
  * Analyzing photographs, film, etc for abstract ideas and concepts creates a huge gray area, which is left up to the researcher to interpret.

Maybe this is just cultural sociology/anthropology&#8217;s way of adapting to the future. This way, everyone has his/her own shot at being a sociologist by interpreting what films, pictures, and communications mean in the same way that in the past few years millions of people have the chance to write internet code and have their own web page. Yet this way everyone with a camera can be their own sociologist, and the people with hard-earned PhDs go the way of the IT specialists who get fewer and fewer calls. Or perhaps it the begining of a developing interest in all things societal. Oh, the possiblities.
