It's been an interesting day for user group and event organizers. A friend shared Sam Stepanyan's [tweet][1] that started it all:<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

      If you are using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeetUp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MeetUp</a> it's time to look for an alternative provider: from November they will charge you $1 per RSVP of a FREE event, so if you have 1000 attendees RSVP-ing to your FREE meetup you as the organiser will be charged $1000 per meetup <a href="https://t.co/eq78hPRW2b">https://t.co/eq78hPRW2b</a> <a href="https://t.co/HSaBFTXYOY">pic.twitter.com/HSaBFTXYOY</a>

That's right, either your attendees pay $2 to attend an event you want to put on \*for free\* or absorb the fees as the organizer of a free event. 

The [replies to Sam's twee][1]t keep growing. There is plenty of good reading there on alternatives and reactions. Could it be a cash grab for parent company WeWork? What are other tools? Are alternatives mature enough? Could Meetup inflate attendee numbers and charge organizers ridiculous fees? 

I want to know what other group organizers are doing. So far, I've heard from international folks that non-profit status will help. Others already use Meetup Pro and are shielded from the fees. One AWS ugroup leader suggested Amazon/AWS just build their own platform for us!

## Off to Eventbrite for me.

What I want to know is what's next. I've polled Slack groups, emailed fellow organizers, and generally searched for how others are reacting. 

Just deleting the AWS Chicago Meetup group and events is not an option, since that is how most AWS users find us. We have over 4,700 people in the group (now I wonder if those are all real!?). Each monthly event draws about 200 RSVPs, and roughly 60 attendees. 

#### Doing it right unintentionally 

For over a year now I've been double creating events in Eventbrite and posting to Meetup. Luckily, I've been on to something. 

On Meetup, I do not allow folks to RSVP, and instead direct them to Eventbrite. I started this in January 2018 when an event host's building required a exact list of attendee names that matched IDs to get in. More than 5 user group members promised they'd RSVP'd but weren't on the meetup list. Meetup does not give me, the organizer/group owner a good way to export an attendee list &#8211; it's a PDF of people's meetup names. So a "Bob S" or "sequin37" can register but that's pretty useless for ID checks. 

I hated having to turn people away from that event so I switched to the Meetup-as-an-advertisement and Eventbrite-as-event-tool set up. It's another step user group members have to go through. I have to double post events (and frequently make typos). I also started using an email list to announce events and drive people to Eventbrite. 

#### Current process for events<figure class="wp-block-image">

Unintentionally I set up a way to avoid this stupid charge-for-attending set up. Here's what I do:

  * create Eventbrite event once I have all the details &#8211; date, time, location, sponsor/host, and talk topics. Copy link. 
  * create Meetup event and copy/paste info from Eventbrite. I click through &#8216;create' &#8216;announce' and then quickly select &#8216;close to rsvps' 
  * add link to Eventbrite event in at least 3 locations on the Meetup page
  * email the group via Meetup announcements and the mailing list (I use Mailchimp) with links to Eventbrite
  * share on twitter and Linkedin. Then do it again 2 weeks before and the week of. 
  * still answer emails like this: <figure class="wp-block-image">

## Questioning the approach

**should AWS Chicago charge attendees to encourage accurate headcount?** NO! This is a gating factor to anyone who can't pay electronically. I want free, open, equitable events.

**should AWS Chicago just pay up for Meetup Pro?** I'm strongly opposed to paying this ransom to support an organization that is so poorly run. 

**can AWS Chicago just use Eventbrite?** Maybe. Meetup does seem to be the way new folks find the AWS user group so I'd hate for anyone to miss out on finding the group. Meetup is unfortunately pretty embedded into tech user events and communities. Eventbrite is built for one-off events and I find it hard to build community through it. There is no concept joining or managing a group on Eventbrite (yet?). 

## A quick rant on how terribly this was announced

  1. Organizers / group owners found out when everyone else did. Heck, I found out from a link to a tweet. I still haven't seen an email from Meetup or any details for group owners. 
  2. Changes to the announcement page throughout the day. Originally the page had a $1 option but it's been updated. Luckily [someone captured changes.Â ][2]
  3. Zero heads up. The top of the page says "Beginning in October" but the FAQs says "at the end of October". TODAY IS OCTOBER 14TH. Time is kinda key here, especially for the planners.
