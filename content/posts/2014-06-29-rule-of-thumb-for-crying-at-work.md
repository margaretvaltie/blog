A while ago a friend of mine repeated a pretty good rule of thumb for crying at work.

We were talking about the book <a href="leanin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean In</a>Â and how women work together, or some times don&#8217;t work together. In her old company, a big consulting and accounting firm you&#8217;ve probably hear of, she talked about a certain boss that intimidated everyone. She said everyone wasn&#8217;t sure if it was the boss being intimidating or their peer ( a woman) who was emotional.

Her rule, she said, was &#8220;cry at work the first time and everyone gives you a break. Who knows, you might be going through a stressful week or something personal. But if you cry a second time, then you&#8217;re the emotional wreck who can&#8217;t deal with the pressure.&#8221;

Apparently when the employee in her story cried once, everyone gave her a break. The test came when someone else cried, proving that the boss was the one causing the anxiety rather than a group of weak women.

I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a good rule of thumb, especially as a relatively young woman and new employee. If you can keep it together most of the time, people will respect you. Loose you cool too much &#8211; men and women! &#8211; and you lose that respect.
