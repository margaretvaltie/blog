Jacob and I are back on land after the QM2. We disembarked to Southampton, England this morning after our final free meal with our new friends Chris and Abigail. 

On the ship we met some interesting people, some annoying people and got great travel advice.  At our table were 3 couples: Brits, French/ Americans, and New Jersians, and all of them were apt stereotypes.  The Jersey and French ladies were the whiniest duo and a few dinner conversations got heated and awkward, but we managed to have a good time and enjoy the food.  The French lady was apparently very accomplished (and has 2 of the most merited daughters in the world), but she did tell me she was one of the founding board members and/or on the team of lawyers who helped create the Airbus conglomeration in the EU.

Most of the voyage we spent sleeping in, scavenging the free food areas, playing card games (Jacob cheats at Gin), and talking to couples we ran into.  In the pool on day a Hungarian man gave us some tips for the area and suggested things to do near Budapest, the region of beautiful women.

We got off so early that we had to wait around for shops and hotels to open around 9 or 9.30am, so I gladly drug Jacob to Starbucks. We ran a few errands, booked travel for Greece and found a guest house to stay in for a few days.  We checked in and took a wonderfully long nap.

This afternoon we walked around the shops and came across a mall and a little outdoor festival. It was nice except that it was about 60 degrees outside. We got a SIM card and are now in possession of a European cell phone! We ate some fish and chips and are now on our way to dinner at a Mexican restaurant.
