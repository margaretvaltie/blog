From our night bus from Iguazu falls, Jacob and I went to the tiny town of San Ignacio, in the north of Argentina. It was a good half way point from the falls and the main town in the north where we hope to catch a bus to Bolivia.  The town´s only real sight is the restored ruins of a Jesuit mission from the 1600s.  On the day we got in Jacob and I walked around the tiny town and looked around at the small craft vendors clearly set up where tourists walk.  We had lunch and settled in to our hostel.  The hostel owner told us about a night show that was in English also, so we decided to check it our at 8pm.

At night we went to the ticket window and discovered it cost us more as gringos, and the show was really at 9pm.  After an hour of waiting we started the tour with all Spanish-speaking people.  We were hopeful, but skeptical about the languages the show would be in.  The tour guides gave instructions in only Spanish and our hopes were crushed.

The tour was still interesting although all the narration was in Spanish.  Apparently the mission was founded by Jesuits who were also escaping local gangs of attackers, both native and Portuguese.  The story in the light and sound show was clearly a bit hoaky, since it portrayed a boy befriending the missionaries with music, people joining and happily building the missions.  The best parts of the show were the images (since the sound didn´t really matter to us).  They projected colors and images on the remaining parts of walls, tombstones, and the doors of the central church.  The lights also created people and movement through water spray that lit up and changed color, which made it look like it was really hazy people dancing and walking around us.  The show told the story of how the Jesuits recruited locals to join the mission, build it, and farm the area until Portuguese and Paraguayans attacked and burned the missions.  For over 200 years the mission was abandoned and reclaimed by the jungle until a photographer stumbled upon it and the government cleared it again and rebuilt parts.

The next day Jacob and I took a tour of the missions. Our little English tour was only us and an Israeli couple, but our guide showed us around and expalined what we thought we saw in the show the night before.  Apparently over 70% of the ruins were rebuilt by the government and with help from UNESCO.  It´s a world heritage site and worth the half day of stop over from our tour of the north of Argentina.
