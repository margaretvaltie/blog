In the past 2 1/2 weeks Jacob and I have been to 7 soccer matches-

Ghana group stages: Ghana v. Serbia, Ghana v. Australia and Ghana v. Germany

2 USA games: USA v. Algeria and the heartbreaking loss to Ghana

2 more round of 16 matches: Mexico v. Argentina and Chile v. Brazil.  Unfortunately both of our underdog teams were eliminated.

Next up in our trip-

4 games in or around Jo&#8217;burg

A trip to Victoria Falls and Chobe National Park

A week in Cape Town
