Elinor Roosevelt was right.  The story goes that she visited the Iguazu falls and said ¨poor Niagra!¨

At our hostel pizza party  we met 2 nice Canadians, Andrew and Heather.  Andrew just finished a PhD and they´re on their way to live and work in Germany.  They are just traveling for fun now, and they were going on the early tour/ boat ride the next day also.  On Wednesday the4 of us took the bus to the national park entrance on the Argentinian side of the falls.  Once inside we got in line for the ¨&#8221;Jungle&#8221; tour of the massive falls.

From our line we got in little open-air busses that drove us through the rainforest to the river downstream from the falls.  Our speed boat went over where rapids should be, but since there has been a lot of flooding lately the river was so high it was a less thrilling ride up to the falls.  But once we reached the falls we started getting sprayed by the huge amounts of water even though we weren´t close to the base yet.  First we headed toward the Brazilian falls, which are much closer together and have spray that shoots out from the entire stream of water.  We got close enough to get soaked, then our boat boldly drove up to one of the falls to the Argentinian side and we got incredably close to the falls. For a little while I couldn´t stand to open my eyes because of the force of the water.  Our boat then turned around an backed into the actual waterfall! I managed to open my eyes a little and I couldn´t see across the aisle where other people were sitting.  After about 2 minutes we floated away and pulled up to the shore further away from the falls.

Our boat let us out at the bottom of the hiking trails, which everyone apparently does from the top down.  We hiked to one lookout spot after another and snaked along metal walkways all the way up the hills next to the falls. Each overlook and bridge was amazing. I wanted to take pictures at every stop but even videos couldn´t capture the sheer force of the water plumetting over the rocks.   Most of the metal bridges were equally amazing since you could look down at the water rushing by under your feet.

After about 2 hours of hiking trails, we decided to take the train to the &#8220;garganta del Diablo&#8221; or the &#8220;Devil´s Throat&#8221;.  The train was a nice break to sit for about 10 mintues, then we had a long long walk across more metal bridges over the river to the top of the scary, intense part of the falls.  We got right on top of the 3 sided rock face that makes up the biggest and loudest part of the falls.  I could just stare at the water rushing by for hours- it was like watching individual flames dance in a fire.

After the walk back across the bridge we did the &#8220;eco trail&#8221; back to the park entrance.  We were all pretty tired from the heat, stairs, and walks so we hoped a bus back to the hostel.  Jacob and I went out to dinner later and had our first Argentinian wine of our trip.  So far Argentina has been very impressive!
