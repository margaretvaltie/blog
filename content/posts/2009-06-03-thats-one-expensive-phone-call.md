Good news- there&#8217;s cell service on the ship. Apparently we have our own cell tower, but it costs more to call from the QM2 than Europe. Sorry if I&#8217;m not rushing to call you just yet.

Days 2 and 3 have been very calm days on board. After my last post we went to our first fancy dinner in the Britannia room. We chose a big table of 8 to find some interesting people. We sit with a British couple, a French/ Boston couple and a stereotypical couple from Jersey. The first night was a full table, and we all talked about Jacob and my travels. Within a few minutes, the Frogs offered to get us in touch with their daughter in Paris who could undoubtedly find us cheap housing. They told us to forget the budget in Paris- it&#8217;s the only elegant city we&#8217;ll travel to!

After dinner we went to the Black and White Ball, but we missed most of the activities. After a few minutes watching the MC select the Queen of the Ball (a tie between an older Scottish lady and not young Coloradoan), we went to the &#8220;club&#8221; G32 with DJ Graham Cracker. Just as we decided to have one drink before we leave, we ran into a British couple we met at the pool earlier, Chris and Abigale. They work for another cruise line and are on holiday before their next voyage to the US. We talked, drank and danced until the club closed around 3am, and went back to their stateroom to hang out more. We ended up ordering room service and staying out until 4am (or 5am, since we change the clocks every night).  The next day was a day of recovery for all. We did make it to dinner.

Today we ordered room service breakfast, which included sausage, eggs, ham, and baked beans, juice, and of course coffee.  We hope to meet up with Chris later for the afternoon trivia in the London Pub, and eventually dinner.
