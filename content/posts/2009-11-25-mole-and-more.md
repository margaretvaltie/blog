This Saturday, Jacob and I plan to head off to the North of Ghana.  On our way to our ultimate destination, Mole National Park, we hope to see some exciting cultural and natural things.  We will start with the 2<sup>nd</sup> biggest city, Kumasi.  Kumasi is known for arts and crafts, the largest market in Africa, and the cunning of Ashanti people.  There’s apparently a nice lake nearby with a backpacker’s hostel so we will stay there the first night of our trek. From Kumasi, we hope to stop at a few little sights on the way to Ghana’s next biggest city, Tamale, and Mole National Park.  Our plans include:

Kumasi (city) – the largest market in West Africa and the Ashanti palace

Craft villages Ntonso and Pankrono

Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary

Bui National Park

Mole National Park

Larabanga and the oldest building in West Africa

Wechiau Hippo Sanctuary

Wa (city)

Bogatanga (town)

Paga Pia’s Castle

Paga Crocodile Sanctuary

Tamale (city)

Kintampo Waterfalls

We finally got BossMan to help us out with the plans for our trip.  Considering we work in a travel and tour office, it’s been very difficult to go from ideas to actual planning.  He did find us a driver and 4&#215;4 car to take us on our 7-day voyage to every sight we want to see in the Ashanti and Northern Regions.

We will be on the road from Friday 11/26 until next 12/5
