## Events will Continue as Scheduled

We are monitoring the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> news and health recommendations. Chicago is in a low-risk area, so events will proceed. We are following all public health advice as well as the World Health Organization (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak" target="_blank">WHO)&#8217;s recommendations for mass gatherings</a>. If you do not feel well, please do not attend events. **Always wash your hands!**<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

## Sponsors Needed & Change in event Food

We are expecting a bump in costs. I’m going to follow some new guidelines for group gatherings and switch from “communal food” like pizzas to individual servings like boxed sandwiches. This will increase costs to sponsor food and drink for events, hopefully only by $100 per event.   


We need sponsors for events on March 24, April 13, April 14, June, and Community Day June 11. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chicagoaws.com/faqs.html#sponsorfaq" target="_blank">Read more about sponsorships</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:margaretmvaltierra@gmail.com" target="_blank">get in touch to sponsor</a>!
