After 10 long days in Johannesburg Jacob and I were glad to move on to new countries.  In Jo&#8217;burg we did watch 4 matches- Ghana v. USA,   Mexico v. Argentina, Brazil v. Chile, Ghana v. Uruguay, Spain v. Paraguay.  Sadly we watched the USA and Ghana, our 2 teams, loose in close matches.  In our itinerary all our non-match days were “days of leisure” so we had no plans and more importantly no means of getting around.  We made sure to be especially leisurely, hanging around the guesthouse and watching all the other games on tv.

On day we did emerge from the guesthouse to visit the <a href="http://www.apartheidmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartheid Museum</a>. It was one of the best museums I’ve seen in our year-long trip.  Once we bought our tickets we each got a card with our “new race” listed as either White or Non-European and we had to walk through the corresponding gates to see the first display.  Jacob was White and I was Non-European- just for the first 20 feet of the museum- but our displays were the same.  The opening facts explained what apartheid was and some interesting statistics &#8211; throughout the Apartheid era from 1948 until 1990 thousands of people bureaucratically changed their “official race.” People went from ‘Black’ to ‘couloured’ to ‘Malay’ and ‘European’ yet no one ever went from White to Black or Black to White.

The Museum went through the people of South Africa from the native tribes to the beginning of the National Party and the evolution of apartheid.  Beginning in the 1940s the former fascist supporters took power and immediately started implementing their policies of separate racial areas and White control of industry, land and power.  The National party changed laws to remove majority Blacks and non-Whites from valuable land, required all non-Whites to carry identification passes, and made it illegal for non-Whites to learn anything beyond ‘basic trades’ in schools.

It was very interesting to go through the museum since I’m also ready Nelson Mandela’s autobiography _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Walk-Freedom-Autobiography-Mandela/dp/0316548189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1278853671&sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Walk to Freedom</a>_.  Most of the things I read in the museum Mandela described in his book in great detail.  The museum used photographs, movies, text and diagrams to express the effects of the apartheid minority’s laws on the majority of the population.

For the 4<sup>th</sup> of July Jacob and I decided to embrace South Africa’s _braai_ culture- the bar-b-que.  We met a friendly English couple and went in search of _boerverts_, hamburger meat and the ingredient for Jacob’s Potato Bombs.  We started grilling around 4pm while it was still warm outside but we struggled to get the fire lit with the strong wind.  One of the staff helped us out and magically got a roaring fire immediately.  She explained that the lived “in the bush” for a few years and could make fire from almost nothing!  Sadly no more Americans showed up that night so the 4 of us feasted  and shared with the staff.  The owner, Mike, was especially intrigued by Jacob’s Potato Bomb and was very happy to get one.  We didn’t have any fireworks but we did make a very good international 4<sup>th</sup> of July party.

From Jo’burg we headed to Chobe National Park in Botswana and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.
