After a little mix-up with the hostel (we requested 2 people for 3 nights and got 2 people for 2 nights) we ended up moving across town to a hotel.  For only a little more, we have a bigger, cleaner room and free breakfast and internet. We&#8217;re also across from Hero Square, the City Park, and a few of the famous bathhouses.

After our move, we spent several hours in the nearby Széchenyi Spa Baths.  It had rooms and rooms of saunas, steam rooms, cold pools, warm pools, and hot pools of thermal water.  The water was a weird green color, and the darker the water the warmer the pool.  We spent most of our time inside, but there was also a huge outside area with 3 large pools on either side with identical features.  My favorite part was a hot-tub like bubbling part in the middle of a larger pool.  Every 10 minutes the bubbles would stop in the inner pool and turn the ring between the small pool and the larger pool into rapids that could spin you around the ring.  It was so fast I only had to float to go around and around the little ring.  I think it must be the original water park / lazy river.

After our 3 hour allotment, we returned to the hotel to change.  We went to dinner nearby at Paprika- a recommendation from Ali.

Today we took another free city walking tour.  We met at the main squarebz the famous Gundel Restaurant.    Our guide, Yanus,  walked us over to the National Theater and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  Next we went by the St. Stephen&#8217;s Basilica, the only official basilica outside Rome- according to our guide.

He told us about the history of the city and random tidbits about famous Hungarians.  One story was that Hungarians (Magyars, as Hungarians call themselves) invent more things than any other people for the size of the country. Hungarians were in the US working on telephones and would check them to say &#8220;can you hear me?&#8221; but Americans thought it was something required to say to make phones work, so they repeated (and messed up the original word) and created the word &#8220;hello&#8221;.  Also, Hungarian is one one of the 5 hardest languages to learn because it&#8217;s not related to any other language other than Finish. Adding endings and parts of words can change the word and meaning. Most Hungarian words are multiple words in all other languages.

Next we went to the Buda side of the river via the Chain Bridge.  On the other side is the old Castle, and the ancient part of the city. We walked up the castel steps and went around to the &#8216;Hungarian White House&#8217; where the president lives, and a fortress used by invading armies and the Hungarian resistance in 1956.  We walked over the the Matthias Church and Holy Trinity Square and walked past the Fishermen&#8217;s Bastion.

To wrap up the tour, Yanus took us above a tourist restaurant to an authentic communist-era milk bar.  The food was incredibly cheap and in huge portions, but our guide had to translate everything for us and the people that worked there.  Jacob had a dumpling and pork dish similar to goulash, and I had a strange &#8216;vegetable stew&#8217; that was more like pureéd beans or peas with a giant sausage ball in it.

Our guide also told us many examples of Budapest&#8217;s second-best, second-largest, or second-oldest things.  Jacob and I counted up to 10 at one point-  the second-oldest metro system, the second-largest library, the second-largest parliament building, the second-oldest cable cars, the second-oldest boulevard, the second largest film studeo in Europe&#8230;.  and we forgot the rest.

After the tour, we walked back to Pest and went to the largest Jewish Synagogue in Europe, Dohány Synagogue.  It is surprisingly church/ mosque looking on the outside, with layers of red brick and white stone and 3 onion-shaped dome towers.  Inside was beautiful and ornate. It can apparently hold more than 3000 people at once.   It also had a very nice, but small, museum on the other side. It had ancient Torah, Torah pointers and items recovered from Polish, Austrian and Hungarian Jews and Synagogues.  In the back we discovered a room full of Holocaust items such as propaganda posters, photos from Auschwitz we hadn&#8217;t seen at the camp, and Hungarian people who had helped Jews escape.  I found the &#8216;reused&#8217; Jewish items the most interesting &#8211; someone took Torah and made it into drums and a wove a prayer shawl into a dress.   The synagogue was a great stop and the museum was a nice addition to the tour.

Tomorrow we plan to go to Eger in eastern Hungary.  It is one of the famous wine regions, and in an area known as the &#8216;valley of the beautiful women&#8217;. From there we plan to go to Bulgaria, Romania and the coast of the Black Sea.   Hopefully there will be internet at least in Eger, but posts and emails might be more rare.
