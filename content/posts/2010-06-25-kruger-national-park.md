Between the group stage games Jacob and I took a break from football to visit Kruger National Park on the east coast of South Africa.  Our lodge was in a private game reserve just outside the park, with drivers and trackers who could help us spot the animals.

As soon as we arrived we checked in and then started our afternoon game drive. We rode in an 8-person open air Land Rover and our spotter, Richard, sat in a little seat out on the edge of the hood to get a better glimpse of the tracks.  As soon as we drove out of the fenced in lodge we came across leopard tracks in the sandy road.  Richard hopped down, with his rifle just in case, and walked along the tracks.  He couldn’t find the leopard so we drove on and found a pack of elephants.  We pulled over and parked as the elephants ate and walked right past our car.  As it got dark we found a pride of lions stretching and beginning their night of hunting.  I was amazed how close we were able to get to them. The lions didn’t seem to mind us and walked around the vehicle just feet away from our tracker.  Our driver did tell us not to move or stand up since the lions think the cars are one large animal but as soon as people stand up or walk outside of the car the lions become very interested in eating us!

We opted to skip our “sundowner”, or break to stretch and have a drink as the sun sets, in lieu of a leopard sighting.  From the lion pride we drove further into the park to find the leopard some other trackers had spotted.  It was dark by the time we got there and Richard somehow saw the leopard sitting in tall grass and his fresh kill safely stashed in the top of a nearby tree.  We turned the car off and watched for a long time as we hope to see the leopard climb the tree and have dinner.  Luckily we got to see him climb the tree and eat but we had to move on so we wouldn’t attract the lions to a free dinner.

That night we sat with our fellow Land Rover passengers, Peter and Karen from Australia.  The 4 of us talked and swapped stories from our time in South Africa.

Peter told us that on another game drive their tracker was able to spot a chameleon on a tree in the dark.  It was impressive but we thought Richard was great too by finding leopards, elephants, lions and buffalos all on our first drive.  The very next night we were driving along on another night game drive and Richard stopped the car to show us a chameleon! The 4 of us decided we should have a game tracker competition to compare the amazing skills of all the trackers we’ve had on safari.

In 4 game drives we saw the &#8220;Big 5&#8221; &#8211; elephants, lions, a leopard, buffaloes, and a rhino- plus a hippo, crocodile, hundreds of impalas, kudu, birds of all types and a giraffe.  On Friday we headed back to the land of soccer and Johannesburg.
