## Core rules for creating a solid but practical guideline for your team's social media.

Social media and online branding is best when multiple users pitch in but use a consistent brand voice. So how can you encourage everyone on your team - from a giant marketing firm to a few distributed folks in a brand new startup - while maintaining a professional brand identity online.

**Code & Core Values**

**Personal Responsibility**

Be responsible with your interactions online and never violate the trust of those you are engaging with. If you are communicating about the company or the brand, be sure to clearly identify yourself as an employee.

**Provide Full Disclosure At All Times:** 

  * Use social media to speak for yourself individually, and always be sure to make it clear that what you post is your own opinion, and that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the entire company.
  * Personal blogs that discuss or mention the business, products, employees, customers, partners, or competitors should include a disclaimer. For example, “The views expressed on this [blog; Web site] are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of [company].”

**The Life Span of a Social Media Post **

Whether you are posting about personal topics or topics relevant to the compay, it is important to remember that all social media posts are public and forever. They will be visible to a broad audience indefinitely and may be read out of context.

**Proper Use**

Understand what is required, expected and recommended when operating on each social media platform. Each is different and each has proper and improper uses and codes of conduct.

**Pseudonyms & Anonymous Postings**

The use of pseudonyms, aliases and anonymous postings are strongly discouraged. Do not represent yourself to be anyone other than who you really are, and be sure to comply with all laws and regulations regarding disclosure of your identity.

**Personal Gain**

Do not use your relationship with the brand for personal gain.

**Keep Your Social Profiles Accurate** 

Conflicting information within the profile pages of your social media accounts damages your credibility and could also adversely impact the brand's reputation. Please update your profile pages to reflect these guidelines and your role at the company.
## Avoid Technical Language 
 
Limit the use of ambiguous or technical language that can be easily misunderstood by others online. Do your best to make it easy for the average person to understand your opinion or your position in a concise, clear manner.

##Monitor Responses
If you engage in social media about Cohesive in any way, please monitor feedback and to use your best judgment to respond in a timely and appropriate manner. Failure to reply to comments or postings that come up in response to an employee’s post can have a negative impression.

## IP and Copyrights
Obtain the owner’s permission when using third-party materials. Do not use more than a short excerpt from someone else’s work, and credit and link to the original source. Respect intellectual property and copyrights, including images and quotes.

## Spam & Bulk Postings
Do not bulk-post on social media. Each social media site has a different audience, requirements, and purpose. When sharing content widely, tailor the content.

## Be Considerate & Respect Others’ Rights
 * Be respectful of every individual’s legal right to express opinions, whether you agree with them or not. Be tolerant and considerate of others’ positions and opinions. Do not engage in name calling or behavior that may reflect negatively on you or your company’s reputation. Be knowledgeable, accurate and professional in your on and offline communications.
 * HateSpeech: anything misleading, obscene, false, defamatory, profane, discriminatory, harassing, abusive, threatening, hateful or embarrassing is unacceptable and may be cited as cause for termination.
 * Commenting on competitors should only be accurate and verifiable observations. Do not deride, attack, or badmouth competitors.
* Personal Privacy
All employees have a right to personal privacy. Honor it. Do not post personal information or internal Cohesive content without permission to do so.
* Protect Confidential Information  
You are required to protect trade secrets, IP, and information related to the company's business with our customers and partners at all times.

Never disclose confidential information on or offline. This includes forecasts, earnings, trademarks, upcoming product releases, products, strategy, policy, management, operations, potential and pending acquisitions, and nonpublic financial information such as future revenue.

### A note on Personal Social Media
Your blog, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts are YOUR voice. Use your social media to build your own brand. Share your thoughts, experiences, etc. Use your social media accounts to show how you continue to grow in your area of expertise.

Your social media is a powerful way to give your honest and authentic thoughts on trends, news and companies. Any recommendations or opinions should come with a a disclaimer that you work for the company or have an existing relationship.

Use common sense. The Internet is FOREVER. Be polite, respect IP, be authentic and consider your public audience when you write. I recommend not to reference your employer in your username or identity. Feel free to reference your employment in the about section of your accounts but be sure to add something along the lines of “views are my own”.

Good luck, and share on!
