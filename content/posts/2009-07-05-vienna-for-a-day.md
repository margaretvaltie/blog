Sadly, we missed our Wednesday morning 7am train to Vienna.  I looked at my phone to discover it was 7.05, and our alarms didn&#8217;t go off.  We hurried to the train station to find that the only other train was a night train at 10pm.

Since we practically had another day in Krakow we decided to do what a few other hostel guests told us was &#8216;not to miss&#8217;- the Wielczka Salt Mines just outside of the city.  We took a hot bus to the mines, and arrived right in time for an English tour.  The mine was very impressive. It is apparently 9 levels of depth and would take a person 30 days to walk the entire length of the tunnels, chapels and open rooms.  The areas we walked through had carvings by the miners and wax figures who represented the different types of miners.  Miners were respected and often paid in salt and didn&#8217;t suffer the normal mining illnesses such as blindness and lung problems.  They were still mining salt until 1996, when it was too expensive to keep digging.  Our guide told us we are the gold mine now.

The most impressive part was the large church carved out of the salt rock, of course with it&#8217;s own JP2 statue.  The church took almost 10 years and only 3 miners carved all the reliefs and the stone alter.  It was also a wonderful relief to be in the mine, where it was about 50-60 degrees all year.

We went early to the train station and began setting up our little bunks in a 6-person sleeper car.  Fortunately, our entire wagon was filled with other backpackers and young travelers, so we felt safe after hearing about all the sketchy night trains.  In our cabin we met Dan, the first American we&#8217;ve come across since my parents and co-workers in Paris.  Dan is from Boston and just got laid off, but he&#8217;s spent his severance package on booking tickets to Europe and traveling around.  He hadn&#8217;t booked a hostel yet, so we went together to Wombat Hostel where we had a reservation.

We couldn&#8217;t get into our rooms until after noon, so from 8 till 12 we walked around and bought a 24 hour tram/ subway ticket.  We made good use of our tickets and hoped off the tram when we saw some cool old buildings and churches.  We walked through the park and sat for a while watching people, tourists, and people with dogs.  It wasn&#8217;t a proper tour of the city, but we wandered by most of the important things without knowing exactly what they were.

Once our rooms were ready we showered and rested, then went out to get some authentic Wienerschnitzel at a cafe.  Later in the afternoon we took some more trams around the city, and discovered the Sigmund Freud Museum.  It was his original apartment and clinic where he wrote most of his works, collected crazy amounts of Egyptian and Greek artifacts and books, and corresponded with Einstein.  He fled Austrian in 1938 to go to London, and took all of his books and belongings, so the museum had mostly photographs and copies of what used to be in each room.   We didn&#8217;t spend too much time inside because it was not air conditioned, but it was a decent visit.
