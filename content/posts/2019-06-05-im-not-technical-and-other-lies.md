This is the written out version of my [DevOpsDays Houston talk][1]. <figure class="wp-block-image">

In March this year I started as a program manager at Morningstar. I’m on an internal Cloud Services team within central technology. Before Morningstar I was a Solutions Engineer. That job title forced me to correct a big lie I’d been telling. I used to say I’m not technical but that’s a lie.

“Technical” without context can only be a good measure of skills if there is context. Did you know using a fork is a technical skill?  We shouldn’t use technical as a gatekeeper for folks who have a different background. <br />My path in Technology I started in marketing for a network software company. I thought staying non-technical would help me convey the 10,000 foot ideas. 

## Write the docs you want to see in the world

  
As I went to more events like AWS reInvent I met “technical” dudebros who assumed I wasn’t “technical” they assumed I wouldn’t know the answers to questions even though I was there to talk about technology. Challenge accepted! Plus I was running the AWS user group after all.   
Around 2 years ago I had a long think about what direction I wanted to go. I talked with some good friends who’d been in the industry much longer than me. I also realized my heart wasn’t in marketing technology and the marketing world is getting more automated. I studied for and passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. Studying for that test is no joke! I know people feel strongly about tech certifications but in my opinion this one moved me from “yeah I know some stuff” territory to a “oh, so you really know AWS” in others’ minds. That external validation really helped me.   
I redubbed myself a “technical marketer” and learned as much as I could about our product, networking and security. The logical place for me to start was our product docs. If I could follow along with the docs I could simultaneous update them and learn. They were massive PDFs and so much text!  
I was very lucky to be in a small company, sitting back to back with our head of Engineering. I’m also lucky he is a great, patient teacher who has homeschooled his now college-age kids. I really appreciate his approach; he refused to touch my keyboard so that I could learn even though I’m sure he wishes he could just type something in very quickly. Together we came up with a project we could both help on. We built an online, searchable, version controlled way to organize the company’s documentation. He update the API docs and taught me git, command line, and more AWS services.  
I realized good docs are made with empathy: I ultimately wanted to help people understand, use, and buy our products. Good docs bring people together and allow collaboration.  
I wanted to write documentation for anyone who may benefit, regardless of if they are “technical” or not.  Plus, good, search indexed docs helped customers find the solution! 

##  DoD AWS FTW

Around that same time I joined [DevOpsDays Chicago][2] as a co-organizer. I was impressed how the group of organizers allows people to contribute in new ways. It didn’t matter what our day jobs might be.   
DoD demonstrated “real devops” in practice: inclusion, respect, transparency. My fellow organizers (who we’re much busier people!!) helped me with git and trusted me with edit access to everything as soon as I joined. I experienced the right way to build a community. I wanted to put the experience into action and use my new technology skills to do it.   
To quote Amazon I wanted to &#8220;drink my own champagne“ Eyeroll.. DoD made me rethink my Chicago AWS user group community.  
Of course I started with documentation.  I realized I needed to be more transparent as a ugroup leader.  I wrote out FAQs rather than repeat the same emails about sponsors or rules about no sales pitches. I created feedback mechanisms for members to share ideas for talk topics so I didn’t just dictate event themes.   
Now the user group has an S3 based static website with a button to self-join the Slack group. I share the annual [“state of the user group” each year][3]. And, we’ve grown to 4,500+ members. Not bad!<figure class="wp-block-image">

I hope I’m proof that documentation helps those who are eager to both learn and teach. I wanted to help others by writing down what I figured out.  The great thing about docs is that you don’t have to be sitting next to someone to learn from them. Your next engineer might already work for you.   
I also realize The hallmarks of good documentation are also the hallmarks of a good community: enable people to learn through participation, continuously improve, get feedback, and enable collaboration.
