To keep up with the latest closures from novel conronavirus, or COVID-19, we will postpone all AWS Chicago user group events.

With school closures and remote work requirements most members are already coping with more important demands of their time. We want to give our presenters, organizers, and members time to focus on higher priorities in life right now. We also would like the events to be community-focused and not a webinar of presentations. We will continue to learn how to do this best.

In the meantime, we have some suggestions for online, self-paced learning from AWS and learning partners. See the post [AWS Guides and Tips][1] with tons of links to resources from just before re:Invent 2019. Also check out the <a href="https://alestic.com/2019/12/aws-reinvent-2019-workshops-jennine/?ck_subscriber_id=512841042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive list of re:Invent workshops from Eric Hammond</a> as well as the AWS Workshops on <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS' GitHub Samples page</a> and the  <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/AWS-Virtual-Workshop_2019_VW_s01-ENT.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Virtual Workshop on Well-Architected Framework.</a> Happy (test) building!
