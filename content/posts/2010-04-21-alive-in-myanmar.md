After an eventful morning in KL we made it to Yangon, Myanmar on Monday.  Our oringinal plan to fly from the islands to KL, pick up our Vietnam visas, and catch a bus to Singapore couldn&#8217;t work since it would have been on Sunday.   Instead we extended our existing flight to Myanmar to start in KL and we gave ourselves 2 hours to get our visas in the morning then get to the airport.  Jacob and I got to the embassy with our bags early early at 7.30am, but the website said it opened at 8.30.  In reality, it opens at 9am but on Monday they had a power issue and opened 45 minutes late!  We rushed and managed to get our visas, hop in a cab and speed to the airport in time.

Our guide&#8217;s brother, Joe, picked us up from the airport and brought us to our swanky hotel.  We changed some crispy USD for Myanmar Kyat at the wonderful rate of 1000K to $1.  Dinner that night only cost us 7,200K!  I have a feeling we will be living like kings on this trip.

Yesterday and today we&#8217;ve been touring the sights of the former capital city, Yangon.  Yesterday Joe showed us around the big pagodas and took us along the docks where men carried huge bags of rice off of anicent Japanese boats along the wide, muddy river.  Our guide, Ye, met us this morning and brought us through Chinatown and to the white elephants.  The elephants are really albino, so they are a light pink color with white hair.  Sadly, they are chained to a cement pagoda-style building.  We watched them as they tired to keep their legs moving to stay healthy. 

Over the next 8 days we will be leaving the internet-capable cities and moving around to the country&#8217;s other big sights.  Hopefully we will be able to write a few more stories when we get to another place with internet.
