On Friday we left Budapest and took a 2 hour bus ride to Eastern Hungary.  We checked into the wonderful hotel Komdon, just outside of town in the valley of beautiful women, <span>Szepasszonyvolgy.  We arrived and got settled, and explored the &#8220;wellness center&#8221; in the hotel. It consisted of a warm jaccuzzi pool, a steam room, and a sauna- not too bad!  We relaxed in the pool for a while and met an interesting couple from Slovakia.  The man was British by birth, and we guessed he moved his business in after the Russians  moved out.  His wife practiced her English on us- she speaks Hungarian, Solvakian, German, and she took Russian in school. She told me that I spoke slowly and was easy to understand- score another point for Southerners.</span>

<span>We planned to go out to the town, but it started raining after dinner. We opted to stay in and get ready for a full day of wines on Saturday.<br /> </span>

<span>After breakfast, we asked where we should go to taste local wine.  It was apparently like our friend Francis&#8217; question in Bordeaux- there are about 48 wineries literally across the street from the hotel, and it was a festival weekend in town. We went across the street to the wine sellers, who sell wine out of shallow caves carved out of the hills.  Inside are still the chisle marks, giant wine casks, and older winemakers who offered us samples of the dry reds, semisweet reds and whites, and the super sweet Muscat red wines.  We tried all types of wine, but we both tend to prefer dry reds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the semi-sweet Merlot (red) and I did like the candy-sweet Muscat, but we didn&#8217;t care for any of the whites or rose.  The Ergi Birkaver (Bull&#8217;s Blood), which is what the valley is renound for, was not our favorite either.  It was incredably dry red mix of Cabernet Savenon or Franc and Merlot. </span><span>Around 12 we stopped for lunch so we wouldn&#8217;t be too happy to taste the wines. </span>We also learned/ butchered the Hungarian words for &#8220;cheers&#8221; and &#8220;thanks&#8221;, but no mater who we said it to they gave us confused looks, corrected us, and made us repeat it.  I don&#8217;t think I quite mastered either word.  
<span>Chris- if you&#8217;re buying Egri wines, it seemed like 03 and 08 were good years, fyi.</span>

 <span>Next, we went back to the hotel for our scheduled massages, which were conveniently 50% off. They used wine-soap, grape seed oils and a grape scrub to continue our wine-themed weekend. We avoided the overbearing Slovakians, thankfully.<br /> </span>

<span>For dinner we went to the center of Eger to the wine festival.  We got coins to trade for glasses of wine and dinners, which were all very nice.  The festival was like a combination of the Main Street Festival in Franklin and White Linen Night in NOLA.  After walking around, we decided it was an older, touristy crowd and we could sample and buy wines for fractions of the cost back in our cellar/ seller valley.  We went back to the places we enjoyed most, and ended up buying 8L of wine in plastic jugs.  The jugs are cute mini casks, Roman-looking vases, or giant water bottles all made of thick plastic.  They don&#8217;t look like much, but we got some great wines for very cheap prices! </span>

<span>On our last day we spent some time in the spa pool before we had to check out and catch a bus back to Budapest.  From there, we went to the train station to wait for our 15-hour train ride to Bucharest, Romania.<br /> </span>
