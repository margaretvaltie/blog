From our beach weekend-  
1.  Our  hut by the beach  
2.  Anna and Jacob venture into the huge waves and cold water  
3. Fishermen pull giant nets onto the shore- it took the whole village to get the next out of the rough surf  
4. Anna and Jacob look on as Emmanuel teaches other Ghana Spirit staff to play backgammon. In return they taught us a Ghanaian version on checkers  
5. The sunset on our last night
