I am still recovering from a week in Vegas at re:Invent. Seriously, I think all 45,000 of us got a cold at the conference!

It was a busy week in the desert. There is plenty to talk about in 2018! For some refreshers on the product and service announcements, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlights from AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/aws-reinvent-day-two" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Day 1 and Day 2 reviews</a> on InfoQ.

Personally, I enjoyed getting to meet fellow user group leaders from around the globe. There are amazing groups all over &#8211; Dublin, Munich, JAWS (Japan AWS), and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7403992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South American AWS en Español</a>. I've got so many great ideas for 2018 user group topics!

**2017 lookback**

From the puny Meetup.com stats, it looks like the group has grown by over 500% from early 2016! We hit our goal of having regular, monthly events. I've been working on getting new speakers, more technical talks, and a diverse lineup of presenters &#8211; still a work in progress.

**Big things for 2018**

Part of my master plan for 2018 is **already here.** There's a new <a href="http://chicagoaws.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChicagoAWS.com website</a> with info for sponsors, speakers, and hosts. Plus, a written code of conduct. Luckily we've never had an issue at a user group event, but this is an effort to be welcoming, transparent, and prepared. Also on our website is an invite form to <a href="http://chicagoaws.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the AWS Chicago Slack channel</a>.

Up next in 2018, I've got plans for a few all-day, hands-on sessions a year. We'll hear from more AWS solutions architects, and hopefully more user group members. I'll also send out a survey to get more feedback and ideas from the community.

Stay tuned for dates and announcements in January.
