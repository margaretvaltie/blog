#### Today was our first full day in Bordeaux, France.  We spent the rainy morning attempting to get oriented and stay dry. We went to the tourist info center, signed up for 2 wine tours and, with a few hours to kill,  asked for directions to the Cathedral. The guide told us the long way apparently, and we arrived to find it was closed on Mondays. We ate baguettes and caught a tram back to the info center and were off on our first wine tour:

Mondays the bus goes to the Blaye and Bourg areas of the greater Bordeaux region. These vineyards are to the west, or east coast of the Garronne River, and all plant a majority of Merlot, Cabernet savenion, and Cabernet franc vines and make red wine. Our guide, Bridgette, was a bit crazy. She explained that they make a champagne wine here with the same grapes and process but it is not champâgne, but it is a champagne. Thankfully, I knew that champagne can only come from Champagne regions, because that explanation made no sense.

The first vinyard was very touristy and disappointing. Chateau Rousselle, the second one had excellent wines, the proprietress was very informative (unlike our Brigette) and we toured the vineyard, cellar, vats, and had a tasting. The lady was feisty and funny, and she clearly didn&#8217;t enjoy our guide butting in.  She was describing how we should all try wines and make our own decisions about what we like rather than pay for expensive things &#8216;experts&#8217; tell us to like. Bridgette interrupted with, &#8220;yes, it is like the wines are like famous art and&#8230;&#8221; The lady interrupted her with &#8220;No! Absolutely not! I disagree. Wine takes knowledge to judge but your taste is your own; no it is nothing like art!&#8221;  I liked her.

After the tour, we returned to Bordeaux and went to dinner with another couple, Francis and Erin. They are currently working in London, travel frequently and are looking to potentially move again to Sydney, Hong Kong, or Vancouver. Francis is also Nigerian by birth and knows some people in Accra, Ghana. We had a great meal and deduced that there must have been a strange market nearby, judging by the random pieces of furniture, musical equipment and people walking by our outside table. It was a great day to buy couches, tables, and bar tables today.

Francis told a funny story from their long weekend- at dinner the first night he asked the waiter for a suggestion for wine for dinner, considering we are the &#8220;heart of wine country.&#8221;  He asked the waiter for the local wine, and the man paused, gave him a blank stare, and replied &#8220;Bordeuax.&#8221;   Gee, thanks. Francis said he felt like a total idiot.
