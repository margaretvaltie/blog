Thursday night we took a night bus from Vilnius to Warsaw, Poland and arrived at 5am.  We met a Kiwi in our hostel who was making the same trip, and we talked for a few hours of the ride, until we fell asleep.  The countryside was very interesting- I&#8217;d call it a mix of southeaster Kansas hills, North Carolina pine tree forests, and farms of rural Tennessee. Since we were so early, our hotel wouldn&#8217;t let us check in until about 2pm so we sat in the loby and played cards, read and worked Sudoku. Apparently our sit-in worked, and we got a room at 9am as soon as another guest checked out.  Right after we got in and put our bags down we signed up for the morning city tour.

The tour guide, Ewa, was like our first wine tour&#8217;s guide Bridgette&#8217;s Polish cousin. She was informative and nice but she seemed to be very flustered when our group wandered off to take a picture or didn&#8217;t follow her quickly enough. We had an Australian family on the tour with us and the boy wandered off frequently and then went to buy a Subway sandwich at one point- I thought she would loose it!  My favorite moment with her was when she was asking if we had family or ancestors from Poland, except she asked: &#8220;Do you know your heritage Was your family Polish or do you not know?&#8221; Um, none of the above?

We drove around the nice buildings and embassies on the Royal Road, and walked around the palace gardens by the Belvedere Castle (yes, like the vodka).  Next stop, we went to where the ghetto was in 1940. The only way you can tell there was a ghetto there was a simple monument marking the struggle of the Polish Jews against the Nazis- everything else was destroyed by the Nazis and then build over by the Soviet and Polish communists.  It&#8217;s amazing how little of the pre-war city remains, although Warsaw has done a good job of building new buildings and recreating the parliament, city walls, and the old town.

After the tour we went to a fancy old-style Polish restaurant in the old town. We figured that if we saved money by not getting a hotel the night before a nice lunch would make up for it.  The food was amazing!  We walked back to the hotel and finally got to catch up on our sleep. Since it was rainy and getting late when we woke up, we deided to go see a movie in the new mall next to the Soviet Tower. I agreed to see Transformers 2 and now Jacob owes me an Ice Age in 3D (or _Epoka Lodowcowa_ in Polish) I think I win.

We&#8217;ve just arrived in our next city, Krakow. We decided to only spend 1 1/2 days in Warsaw because of advice from numerous other travelers and my cousin, Mike, who lived and taught English in Poland.  He suggested to look at gray communist buildings from the train to Karkow, and also suggested a &#8220;[communist tour][1]&#8221; in Nowa Huta outside of Krakow.   We&#8217;ve planned many things including the Auschwitz-Birkenau camps, the Wieliczka Salt mines, a free city tour, and maybe even a brewery tour or a day in the countryside.  This way we have enough time to slow down and do laundry, repack our bags, and meet people.  Following more of Mike&#8217;s advice, we&#8217;re staying in the [Hostel Orange][2] (there&#8217;s also a Hostel Yellow &#8211; how original).
