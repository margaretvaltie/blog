Sorry, Ali I totally stole that line from you.

Yesterday we took the morning train from Bratislava to Budapest, Hungary.  We got in around 1pm and found our hostel relatively easily.  On our way, we took a tram that suddenly stopped and everyone got out because there was a tram accident further ahead.  We walked the rest of the way and watched as the transit people rushed to the scene to tow the broken tram- lightning speed compared to a streetcar accident in NOLA.  We&#8217;re staying on the 4th floor of a beautiful, if slightly deteriorating, old building on the main road.  Our hostel, [Riverside Hostel][1],  is near the Opera in Pest, the side of the city east of the Danube River.  It&#8217;s been a rather quiet hostel, which is nice after our very social hostel in Bratislava. After we got set up and rested, we went out to dinner for some authentic Hungarian food.  Jacob is convinced his goulash was just like the goulash with spritzen his family makes.  After dinner we got ice cream and strolled to my island, Margaret&#8217;s Island or Margitsziget.

Today we got a little turned around looking for a restaurant our host recommended, but we eventually found it and had a wonderful lunch.  It took longer than expected, so we decided to skip the Soviet Monument park tour we had planned and went straight to the meeting point for a wine tour we&#8217;d signed up for.  Sadly, either the guide didn&#8217;t show up or we were in the wrong place.  After waiting for a while in the square on the Buda side of the river, we attempted to find our way to the Monument tour bus. We got turned around more and got very different directions from everyone we talked to.  Finally, we found the bus and drove about 15 minutes to the area.

The Statue Park/ Memento Park is a collection of Soviet Hungarian statues and plaques idolizing Stalin, Lenin, Engels, and Hungarian &#8216;heroes of communism&#8217;.   We took some pictures on and around the statues since it&#8217;s rather impossible to disrespect fallen communist idols.  They also had interesting films about the secret Hungarian police and training films for agents.  My favorite was a real recording of a man watching a potential dissenter and friends eat birthday dinner.  On the radio between agents you could hear them talking about how long a stakeout it would be. One agent said he was thankful for his egg sandwich, but the other one hadn&#8217;t eaten all day.  The video agent then saw the targets eating another round of food and muttered, &#8220;Assholes. Traitors.&#8221;  
Communism doesn&#8217;t pay, apparently.

After the tour we took the tram along the river to look at some of the big sights of the city, like Parliament, the Castle, and numerous beautiful churches.  We stopped by a Turkish kebab/ gyro shop for dinner. It was very good but not quite to the level of Ali Baba in New Orleans&#8230; we&#8217;ll wait till Greece to decide what&#8217;s better.
