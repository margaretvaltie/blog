1. Jacob and I with our friend Ben and one of his friends  
2. Ben and his friends from high school at the wake for Ben&#8217;s mom.  Ben is seated in the middle, wearing the &#8220;I love Mama&#8221; t-shirt  
3. Ben and his mother at the wake.  
4. Ben&#8217;s dad (the Chief) and other chiefs process in for the funeral service  
5. A lady watching the funeral with a curious kid on her back  
6.  The crowd waiting for the funeral to start. I especially like the 2 guys reading a newspaper in the foreground  
7.  The mourners carry the coffin (on their heads) to Ben&#8217;s house before the burial. A political party flag and band are walking along the coffin, to the right.  
8. Nii Onamon Soru, the Chief, sitting under the tents outside his house on Sunday
