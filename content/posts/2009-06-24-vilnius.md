On our Vilnius walking tour, we walked through the artists&#8217; district, Uzupis with murals and strange sculptures in the quasi-serious independent state.  Next was the view from one of the 7 hills of the city, and walked down one of the &#8216;smallest streets in Europe&#8217; which was about 3 feet wide.

That night we went to the Midsummer festival in a park near the city. We danced in the circles around the giant bonfire and blended in with native Lithuanians.

Today we walked around the city, which is mostly closed because of the holiday. We walked by St. Anne&#8217;s and the Benedictine churches.  Apparently, St. Anne&#8217;s was Napoleon&#8217;s favorite church when he stayed here in his ill-fated attempted to invade Russia. He left over 50,000 dead French soldiers behind because of the cold, and they are apparently buried throughout the city. They&#8217;ve only found about 8,000 bodies and are afraid to dig in case they might have also been buried with Plague victims.
