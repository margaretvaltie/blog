On our second day in Bordeaux we signed up for another wine tour, but this one was all day and much better than the huge group with crazy Bridgette. It was worth the expensive price- we ended up going to 4 chateaux with at least 2 tastings at each with little appetisers, a full 3 course lunch with 5 wines, and a comprehensive tour of the area and vineyards.  Our tour went to the Margeaux region north of Bordeaux. At each vineyard, we learned a little more about the growing process, the wine making process, age and names of wines, and distribution and the marketing of different wines.

I felt like I knew a little about American wines (merlot vs cabernet grapes ), but French wine names and regions are much more intense.  We learned that at least 90% of all wine in France are blended wines, so there won&#8217;t be any French wine labeled as Merlot or Cab. Instead, they value the land in the region where the grapes grew over the type of grape.  Wines from Bordeaux are grown in rocky, gravely soil and are drier than other regions of France.  Most Bordeaux are red wines with blends of merlot, cabernet savignon, and cabernet franc grapes, but there are a few dry and sweet white wines also allowed to be called Bordeaux wines.

Also, we learned about the quality of wines in Bordeaux according to the government wine laws (only in France, right?) Bordeaux has many rigid regulations on wine production, and there are 3 leveles of quailty.  If a Margeaux vineyard meets all the rules and produces small, high-quailty batches of wine they may be labled as Margeaux, Bordeaux.  If a vineyard does not meet all the rules or produces higher quantities of wine it is Cru Bourgeois. The lowest level of quality allowed, or vineyards that do not follow all the regulations and produces large quantities of wine is simply Bordeaux.  So if you see a wine that is only labeled as Bordeaux, it&#8217;s actually the lowest quality level of wine from the region.
