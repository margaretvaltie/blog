<div>
  In my world, the Chicago AWS user group wraps up in early December. Post-reInvent there isn't much time to plan an event beyond a Holiday Party. Plus, on the plane back from Vegas I was able to pour my brains onto a page.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Thinking back to last year we had a lot of hits:
</div>

  * <div>
      Â membership keeps growing. Over 4,200 Chicagoans
    </div>

  * <div>
      Moved from spotty <a href="http://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> attendance to Eventbrite tracking â€“ easier for hosts and security. No more â€˜you canâ€™t get inâ€™ after jan 2018 event (sorry!) and No more waitlists!
    </div>

  * <div>
      More and different sponsors, hosts, venues
    </div>

  * <div>
      More and different talks, speakers and topics
    </div>

  * <div>
      1st ever <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aws-community-day-midwest-tickets-45049510298#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community day in Chicago</a>Â working with regional ugroup leaders
    </div>

  * <div>
      Growing interactions with AWS Chicago office and awesome SAs, reps
    </div>

  * <div>
      <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/serverless-mini-conf-with-aws-tickets-50745716805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serverless workshop</a>Â with the Serverless group â€“ 1st hands on, longer format event
    </div>

  * <div>
      More events with other Chicago groups like OWASP, serverless and DevOps
    </div>

  * <div>
      First ever <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Chicago/events/257908229/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galentines Day event</a> â€“ for women/nb by women/nb but not exclusive
    </div>

  * <div>
      1 full year of having website with FAQs, contact form
    </div>

  * <div>
      Another year with a code of conduct and no incidents or complaints
    </div>

  * <div>
      Slack group has grown and more active &#8211; #askexperts and #jobs most active
    </div>

<div>
  Rooms with improvements:
</div>

  * <div>
      More diversity efforts â€“ no women applied to speak at Community Day. More intro-level topics to welcome all levels. We'll be adding pronoun stickers to all events to be more welcoming.
    </div>

  * <div>
      Community day was very Chicago heavy, with speakers and attendees. But let's be honest, Chicago AWS users are the best ðŸ˜‰
    </div>

  * <div>
      More AWS topics like IoT, ML, AI, mobile, enterprise/work tools, topics for non-tech folks like APN partnerships, on boarding, managing, etc
    </div>

  * <div>
      There are tech evangelists in USA - let's get them to Chicago
    </div>

  * <div>
      We emphasized in person events with no recording/ live stream but it didnâ€™t change attendance or help anyone who canâ€™t be there for schedule/mobility/social obligations reasons
    </div>

  * <div>
      Still not 100% transparent about talks vs pitches for sponsors. Need better ways to clarify with sponsors and convey value of $$
    </div>

  * <div>
      More repeat sponsors and speakers. Balance â€˜the usualsâ€™ and newbies
    </div>

  * <div>
      Website updates â€“ blog? newsletter archive; bigger links to slides/videos past; updates; photos from past?
    </div>

We did another year-end survey, and got great feedback. I'm so glad I've just asked people what they want for topics rather than guessing! The usual topics are always big: security and serverless. New topics requested are containers, infra as code, and AI. I'm excited to put them together.
