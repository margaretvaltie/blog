After about a week in sunny and warm Hong Kong we flew to the middle of winter in South Africa. It is still rather warm for winter, but after months and months of 30+ C the chilly air feels incredibly cold!

As we checked in to our flight in Hong Kong the desk agent worried us by asking if we had proof of FIFA World Cup tickets, onward travel and contact information in South Africa. But once we arrived all we had to do was get 2 passport stamps and get the approval of the drug sniffing dogs at baggage claim. Outside security was another matter- the waiting area was packed with people looking for each other.  Somewhere in the crowd we hoped to find our &#8220;guides&#8221; for the next 5 days.  Since we couldn&#8217;t find them, we went upstairs to the FIFA ticket pick-up.

The line for tickets was already across the long room and starting to loop back on itself at 7.30am when we found it.  FIFA had set up 5 machines for the entire airport pick-up point and for the next 3 hours all 5 machines either crashed or never worked.  We worked our way closer to the front just from people leaving the line in frustration.  Finally by about 9am 2 machines worked, then each failed a few times, and all the machines worked.  One of the machines was simply unplugged the entire time and the operator just plugged it back in! People had started cutting in line since the security people refused to section off the lines to tell anyone what to do.  At one point Jacob seemed to be able to tell the security chief how to handle the lines!

After our 3 hours in line we were very happy to find Gideon, our &#8220;host&#8221; for the next 5 days. Both &#8220;guides&#8221; were Ghanaian and we were excited to reunite with people who could help us dust off our Twi.  Gideon and our driver, Felix, took us to a guesthouse in Regent Park.  A few days later we told some other South Africans that we&#8217;d stayed in Regents Park and they howled at the thought of us staying in such a seedy part of town.  Without knowing what part of town we were really in we were mainly just cold in the unheated, tile-floor room and were very happy to move to a guesthouse in Orange Grove.

Our hosts promised us a few &#8220;tours&#8221; of the city, but they consisted of driving around downtown streets, traffic jams and drop-offs in a few shopping malls. To add to the frustration, Felix was chronically late each day.  When he told us 10am he really meant 2pm, and one morning his only excuse was that it was too cold to get out of bed!!  We did get to see the Top of Africa, a vantage point at the top of the tallest building in South Africa.   During our several days of mall wonderings we did buy some wonderful matching USA jackets. We&#8217;re quite fashionable and patriotic now.

On the positive side, our new guesthouse was on the same block as the Radium Beer Hall.  We spent just about every night in Johannesburg watching soccer games on the big screens and meeting fellow fans. Every South African we talked to was incredibly nice, although we did hear several off-color comments about race (pun intended).

Some of the nicest South Africans we met were Samuel, Adrien and Jaqui.  On our last day in Jo-burg we were so fed up with Felix and Gideon that we canceled our &#8220;tour&#8221; and spent the day watching soccer in the Radium.  The 3 were sitting at a table and invited us over to watch the games with them.  After most of the day, they invited us over to their apartment to watch the South Africa match and eat some curry.  It was wonderful to meet some genuinely nice people, and also to vent about the terrors of our &#8220;tour&#8221;.

Thursday Felix and Gideon drove us to Rustenburg, about an hour outside Joburg.  We very happily said goodbye to them and started our pre-booked arrangements. From now until we leave South Africa our accommodations, transfers and travel are taken care of and we won&#8217;t have to worry about &#8220;guides&#8221; asking for more money partway through the tour.

We lazed around our wonderful guest house the rest of the day and journeyed into Rustenburg yesterday to watch the USA vs. Serbia game on tv.  We met some more Aussies and a Macedonian-Aussie who commiserated with us about the terrible call that cost the US our win.

Today we are going to watch the Ghana vs. Australia game at 4pm.  Go Ghana!
