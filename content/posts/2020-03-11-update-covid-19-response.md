## March and April Events will be Virtual

With updates from the local Chicago government and other tech communities, we will move to virtual events in response to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel conronavirus, or COVID-19</a>.

Chicago remains a low-risk area but the latest public health advice from the CDC and <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recommends "social distancing". **As always, please stay home if you feel sick and wash your hands!**

### March and April Virtual Events in the Works

Stay tuned for how we will be conducting events!
