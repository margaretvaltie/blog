Sunday our friend Deborah showed Jacob and me around downtown Buenos Aires on her day off.  We met up in Palermo Soho, our neighborhood about 20 minutes from the city center.  We hopped on the subway and emerged at the Obelisk to the republic.  After a few touristy pictures we walked to the political center of town.  The presidential palace is not called the white house, but the Pink House since it&#8217;s a pink brick building.  Deborah walked us by her work and the imposing political buildings downtown.

By 2pm Jacob and I were very hungry so we detoured on Deborah&#8217;s tour to find a lunch spot.  In the cute old neighborhood of San Telmo we found a sandwich shop that looked incredibly like Rue de la Course in New Orleans.  Jacob got the largest hamburger I&#8217;ve ever seen!  Also in San Telmo we found a large street market along the old squares and streets.  There were street performers, tango shows, and artisans selling leather goods, the ubiquitous mate cups and straws, and jewelry.

As it got darker we walked back past the downtown, over the river and into the new part of town.  <span style="color:#000000;">Puerto Madero was an older dock area, but it&#8217;s recently been restored and has beautiful new condominium buildings. Along the shore we stumbled across a Brazilian dance performance.  We said goodbye to Deborah back at her apartment and found a sushi restaurant near our hostel. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">While Deborah worked we tried out a lunch spot she recommended- a Manger.  It was outstanding and had wonderful Otro Mundo beer. Monday was Deborah&#8217;s birthday so Jacob and I explored Palermo on our own and met up with Deborah after work.  Deborah and Jacob had been craving Mexican food so we celebrated at a restaurant between her apartment and our hostel.  We&#8217;ve made plans again to meet up for dinner tonight and say goodbyes before we leave for New Zealand. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">On Wednesday, Jacob and I will cross the international date line and speed ahead a day and several hours.</span>
