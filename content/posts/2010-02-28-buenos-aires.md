We arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina after quite possibly the worst flight ever! Our flight was technically a direct flight from Quito to BA, but we made stops in Guayaquil and Santiago, Chile.  We left Quito at 9.45pm, which made the stops  at 11pm and 6am along with a 3 hour time change.  Both luckily and unluckily we stat in the exit rows, with bigger leg room but no recline.  In Santiago we had to get off the airplane, go through security again, then re-board the airplane.

Through all our annoying flying we did find a friend.  Carolyn was staying in the same hostel in Quito, flew with us and is now staying in the same hostel in Buenos Aires! We commiserated about the terrible flight and planned to share cabs to and from the airport except that Carolyn&#8217;s flight was identical to our yet on a different airplane for the final part of the flight.   Once we reunited at the hostel in BA it was reassuring to know that we were all completely exhausted.  I felt much better about sleeping all afternoon once I found out that the flight and time change threw us all for a loop.

We all emerged around 8pm on Friday for dinner, but somehow all felt tired again!  Saturday after finally sleeping enough for 3 nights, Carolyn Jacob and I walked to the Recoleta neighborhood.  My freshman year roommate, Gillian, spent her junior year in Buenos Aires and her favorite area was Recoleta and the old cemetery. We walked around for a while admiring the huge, glass-front mausoleum with ornate statues.  Each building was a completely different architecture style.  It looked like each family had 2 stories of crypt space underneath the tombs, but some were so old that the doors and walls crumbled to reveal some of the stained glass, statues, and coffins inside.

As we walked around Recoleta it reminded me of the outdoor cafes and wide streets of Paris and the shops of Soho New York combined with a Spanish accent.  We talked about our travels and lingered over coffee and snacks until it got dark.  Later that night at the appropriate Argentinian dinner time we met up with Deborah DenUyl, a fellow Tulanian and Theta living and working in BA.  We heard so much about the wonderful steak in Argentina, so we went to a great steak restaurant in between Deborah&#8217;s apartment and our hostel.  We split 3 steaks and a bottle of wine, which were all fabulous, then went out to the busy part of our neighborhood for drinks.
