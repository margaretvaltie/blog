After another day in the sun and around Ohird, Jacob and I went to buy bus tickets to Greece and visit the sights around town.  We accomplished both by about 2pm.

We hiked to the ancient fortress on the hill overlooking the entire lake. It was a beautiful sight- sadly I forgot my camera that day 🙁    We walked around the inside of the fortress, and at first we were afraid to try to climb on the unmarked walls of the reconstructed areas until we saw groups of people climbing all over.  We walked over to the parts under excavation and reconstruction, which was interesting to see without ropes, no entry signs, or tourist traps.

Next we hiked down the hill to an old monastery also partly reconstructed.  It was mainly ruins, but had another great view of the lake and the little town below.  On the way we met a pearl salesman who had great prices, so I just had to visit his stand. 

Further down the hill was an old church, built around 900 according to the city records.  It had been rebuilt, whitewashed, and turned into a mosque and back into an Orthodox church again before becoming the tourist attraction.   Layers of paint, whitewash, and age had been stripped off to show some of the original frescoes.  Both the castle and church had admitance fees, but the wonderful conversion rate made it rather affordable to visit.   We went back to town and the hotel for more shopping to capitalize on the exchange rate.  Jacob got a 3 dollar haircut, and it wasn&#8217;t even that bad.

The next day we took a bus to Bitola, Macedonia which was the closest town to the Greek border.  We took a cab to the border, but no cab would go through the gates.  On our bus we met Yolanda and Elyse, Canadian/ Costa Rican sisters traveling the Balkins.  We split a cab to the border and walked together across the 100- meter distance to the Greek gates.  Once we got there the officer told us it would be a while because the &#8216;computers were not working&#8217;.  After about an hour of watching Greek citizens walk and drive through without much more than glances at passports we realized that the Greeks were holding everyone up simply to irritate the Macedonians.   The large sign over the Greek station proclaimed &#8221; Macedonia was born Greek&#8221;.   

After 3 hours (and a time change, so 4 hours) of waiting the officer suddenly had the ability to check all the passports at once.  We entertained ourselves with card games and exchanging travel stories, as people looked on at the crazy people sitting on the ground with cards. Some Macedonians asked us why we waited, since we weren&#8217;t either nationality.  All the cabs had given up waiting on us on the Greek side, so our new friends suggested we hitchhike.  Apparently they&#8217;d hitched across the Albanian border the day before and had a record to keep.  We tried to call a cab from an empty gas station or flag down another Macedonian driving through now, and after a few minutes we found a nice Greek man who took us near the train station in Niki, Greece.  

We had to constantly ask for the ever-changing directions to the train station, but eventually the 4 of us found the last train to Thessaloniki.  In 20 minutes we were on the road (tracks) again, headed East.  We arrived around 11pm, but we were able to follow Yolanda and Elyse to their hotel by the station and got a room.  It was undoubtedly the most disgusting room and hotel I&#8217;ve ever seen.   We went out to dinner with the sisters, and all stumbled back to the hotel very ready for bed.

The next day we went to the train station to discover that there were no trains to Athens the next day because a rail strike would start at midnight.  We again got on the last train of the day with Yolanda and Elyse. We didn&#8217;t sit together, so we exchanged contact info and Jacob traded Yolanda _Three Cups of Tea_ for _The Cardinal of the Kremlin,_  a Tom Clancy novel.   Thankfully for the strike, we checked our reservations in Athens to discover we had the wrong date, and actually had reservations in Athens for that night rather than the next day.  We avoided the strike and kept our plans intact.
