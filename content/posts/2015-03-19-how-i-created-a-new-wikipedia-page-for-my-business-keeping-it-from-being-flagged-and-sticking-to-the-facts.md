Last year, our CEO mentioned that he wanted to see a page about us on Wikipedia. Competitors had one, so we should get there too.


Much easier said than done! I had one Wikipedia article accepted and published, but one article I heavily edited was rejected. This is my experience working in the <a href="https://sergereuter.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/pr-ethics-and-wikipedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grey area between adding information and working on behalf of commercial interests</a>. I would hardly call this post a best practice post, just my experience.

<figure style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg/220px-Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg.png" alt="Wikipedia logo, via Wikipedia" width="220" height="253" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wikipedia logo, via Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>

**First hurdle**: Apparently someone had tried to create a page about the company in 2008-9 and it was rejected by Wikipedia for not being notable and possible spam. Understandable, since the company hadn&#8217;t been around that long and the text was a lot of sales speak. I wanted to create a new product page separate from the company so it wouldn&#8217;t meet the same fate. I attempted to update company page that was out there and make a new one, both were rejected. I don&#8217;t think I will try to save it at this point.

Focusing on the product as a technology page was what made it through the approval process, in my opinion. I did get an edit and note that it was not up to par, but I added tons more sources (way more than I thought necessary, and tried to have 2 sources for each fact/ detail cited). I took out some of the original &#8220;background&#8221; section and added a version history. I think that&#8217;s what helped it get approved the 2nd time.

### Here's my process and what I learned along the way:
**Collect third party news, reviews, mentions, and websites**

Make sure to capture the title, source, url, and a note about each source. This was easy for me, since our website has a news archive section, so posts were already in chronological order. I just pasted all archived news titles into a text editor and noted all the sources that need 2nd or 3rd party verification (i.e., articles about your technology are much better than press releases from your company).

Getting them in order was a majorly time consuming part. I knew there were some sources out there not on our “news” page, like a blogger who wrote a technical review and other mentioned the product in comparisons.


**Create a Wikipedia account**

PR pros (<a href="https://sergereuter.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/pr-ethics-and-wikipedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rightfully so</a>) strongly <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/11/how-to-develop-a-wikipedia-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advise using your real name</a>, real email and listing your potential conflict of interest on your user page. Then, build up your knowledge and street cred by reading the key Wikipedia guides and making edits and notes in other articles before starting anything new. (links to vital guides below)

Here’s where it gets sticky. I didn’t. I was completely new to Wikipedia and wanted to set up an account I could nuke in case I messed something up while editing.


No matter what you choose to do with your account, do get some hands on experience with other articles. Find totally unrelated topics and just clean up grammar or add in the latest news. More than anything, get a feel for the Wikipedia code and formatting. I used a layout ideas from articles about animals, technology products, and an actor for my technology page so it didn&#8217;t look like other competitors&#8217; pages out there.

**Start a draft of your article**

For me, it made sense to start compiling and editing sources before writing anything. I had most of the sources in chronological order already, and the best way to start writing was to begin with the background of the product / version update history. Then I filled out more information about uses, availability, etc.

Edit and revise multiple times! Write in the user&#8217;s Sandbox to experiment with the layout, code and Wikipedia&#8217;s citations. Also, as you start to edit a real page make sure to add an edit summary to give other editors notes on why you edited that part of the article. I used Evernote to keep my editions and edits through time and track citations and sources.  Other editors will come in and make changes, but remember, that&#8217;s how Wikipedia works! It&#8217;s a community wiki, not a company profile or sales asset.


**Be patient!**  
The review process took months each time. There were mostly minor edits by bots, and they changed formatting, etc. Most people just cleaned up source citations, but there were some critical comments.


It&#8217;s hard to stay objective about the work you did and your company&#8217;s project, but Wikipedia does have rules and passionate editors just trying to keep some order. I think sticking to the facts helped me stay objective and able to justify the article and future edits.

Good luck, and happy editing!
