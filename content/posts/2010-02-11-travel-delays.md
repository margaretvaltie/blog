The 7.45am bus we were suppose to take to Copacabana, Bolivia called our hostel at 8am to cancel our tour. Jacob and I were rather confused since it was just an open ticket bus ride to Copacabana to Puno to Cusco which we could take 24 hours between legs to see each stop along Lake Titicaca.  
We went back to the booking office to protest and find out details. Apparently the Bolivian drivers have had a particularly bad month with the number of accidents and drunk bus drivers. The government put some kind of ban or limit on the drivers, who responded by blocking the roads to several parts of the country. 

Our wonderful front desk lady, who also arranged my doctor visit, suggested a few options for getting to Peru. All other bus companies were not running, an after a fun taxi ride to another section of town we discovered no public biases or micro vans were running either. Givin up on the ground transport of Bolivia we booked a flight directly to Cusco tomorrow. We will miss out on Lake Titicaca and the islands but we will be back on track with our plans.
