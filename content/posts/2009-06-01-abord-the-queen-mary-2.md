Yesterday Jacob and I drove from his mother&#8217;s house in the Berkshires, Mass. back to NYC . It was a nice drive with little traffic- until we hit the city. We spent 45 minutes in traffic only 4 blocks from the parking garage!

At 2pm we met up with my cousins who live in the city, Mike, Megan, and James for brunch at Dos Caminos in Soho. It was also a celebration of Mike&#8217;s first publication in the NY Times &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/magazine/31lives-t.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=Michael%20White&st=cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Night in Villa</a>&#8220;. Megan brought along a copy and asked for an autograph as I photographed the moment. Mike was both flustered and flattered. Once he signed the bill he insisted that he&#8217;d given Megan a terrible version and offered to exchange his signed receipt.



After brunch, we headed down to the Brooklyn docks and boarded the ship. Apparently, it offends the crew to call it a &#8220;boat&#8221; or a &#8220;cruise&#8221;.  At 6.30pm we set sail out of the harbor, past the statue of liberty and away from land. We were busy calling family, sending last emails and watching the boat leave that we completely missed our scheduled 6pm dinner time (the &#8220;early seating&#8221; even though we requested &#8220;late&#8221;). As of noon today, we&#8217;re in line with Nova Scotia  and by noon tomorrow we will be in the middle of the ocean.

Today we wandered the ship, looking for common spaces, buffets, and people our own age. We yet again missed the 10am safety lessions of how to jump off the ship in case of icebergs. At 12.30 we went to a meet and greet for young people ages 18-30, and there are at least 25 or so of us! Apparently there&#8217;s a group from RPI who are going to Italy and China via the Queen. They had to run off to class while we continued to explore the boat.

It&#8217;s sadly too cold to sit outside in anything other than a heavy sweater or coat. People are in the indoor pool area with shoes and long pants- I find it chilly throughout the whole boat. I feel bad for the older people who are probably as cold as I am.

Tonight is a cocktail with the Commodore and crew, a late dinner at 8pm, and the Black & White ball. After that, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll go to the &#8220;G32 club&#8221; to find our young friends again.
