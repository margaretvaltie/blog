During my maternity leave, and now family quarantine, I set a goal for myself to read technical and management books. I also wanted to take some classes online and/or learn Python but I’ve cut back my goals once I realized I can’t do too many things 1 handed and in 10 minute intervals while a baby sleeps. 

I’ve been collecting book ideas in GoodReads. Several titles came up during a DevOpsDays open spaces discussion about communication and management. Baby and I read the AWS Systems Management book for System Administrators together - ok, I read it to her but she listened to it all! Even with sections of code samples, that was easier to read aloud than The Manager’s Path. Hold on, because this review isn’t positive. 

The Manager’s Path is written for a niche. I understand that. But the author wrote to an even narrower audience in my opinion. It is designed as a book for technical folks who are on a path toward more people and team management. Great. But, the author uses examples that are only relatable for developers working in small to mid-sized companies. 

Not everyone lives in Silicon Valley and works at a VC-backed startup! What about folks in operations or QA? So many examples are about shipping code or discussions about software languages. The book assumes all readers are CS graduates who have been working for years as developers. What about career changers and folks with more diverse backgrounds? 

The book is also too narrow on the types of things a new manager must prepare for. It does not include big topics such as how managers must change from code writing (and other technical tasks!!) to managing budgets,  creating financial documents, and reporting productivity to senior leaders.  The author assumes the biggest challenges to mangers will be interpersonal and HR topics. I wish more folks could prepare for the financial fluency that is expected as they progress up levels of management. 

Other topics seem too simplistic, with repetitious advice such as ‘praise in public,  critique
In private’ and sections of a performance review. Even if someone only ever took classes in CS and has never managed they should know the basics of interacting with other humans at work. At least I hope. 

### tips: 
* HAVE 1 on 1s and come prepared  
At every level the one-on-one is key to being a pleasant human to work with, understanding what is really going on, and getting clarification on goals and progress. One bit that is useful -and more people should do IRL - is to come to one-on-ones prepared. No one loves a status update, yet that is what most people do in a one-on-one. 

* Communicate  
Again at every level, actually talk to people. Meet with teams. Meet one-on-one. Tell teams what the goals are, and report up to managers about changes before they happen. Again, be a pleasant human too. 

### My TL;DR:
Meet one-on-one and communicate a ton with people at every level of your career.  Read this book if you're looking for truly entry-level management tips for developers moving to management in a VC-backed Valley startup.
