I was pretty pumped to see the [Chicago Design System][1] announced in early March. The website lists the 'official' city colors, flag design and city emblem, plus a new typeface for large print called Big Shoulders.

I'd been thinking the [Chicago AWS user group website](https://chicagoaws.com/) could us a design update, but I didn't have the motivation to inspiration to do it. The default dark backgrounds on the HTML5 template I'd used seem outdated. A simple Chicago-flag theme with a white background seems better already:

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/awschihomepage.jpg" alt="awschi website homepage" width="400" /> 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/awschidesign.jpg" alt="awschi website homepage" width="400" /> 

Sadly, I still haven't gotten the website set up with a proper CI/CD pipeline to release updates more programmatically. I've spend a few small chunks of time looking into Jekyll, AWS CodePipeline, and GitHub pages for the website. So far none have fit all the criteria I'd like to have. Ideally, I want to use AWS products to learn as I improve the website. The search will continue!
