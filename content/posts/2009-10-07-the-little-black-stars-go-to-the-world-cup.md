Our weekend was relatively quiet, but the definite highlight was Friday night.  We spent the day with Hayford/ BTC and meeting with a few of the Amasaman region’s equivalent of county government officials.  We came along to talk about the miserable conditions of a public toilet facility in the mostly Muslim part of town.  After the meetings we discovered that we were brought along because no government official would turn down a meeting with Obrunis, while BTC has apparently burned a few bridges.  BTC explained to us that all Ghanaians love meeting strangers, and he was able to talk to the people he wanted to meet with because they were excited to meet Americans/ French.

After the meetings and a trip to downtown Accra, Jacob and I met up with Ben and Nii at the Hyde Out Bar in Pokuasi.  We arrived just before the crowd of people- we were all gathered to watch the Ghana vs. Uruguay playoffs for the under-20 World Cup in Egypt.  The young national team players are doing as well as the adult national team, the Black Stars. The adult team is one of the few teams already qualified for the World Cup in South Africa in June 2010.  Both teams’ successes are extremely exciting for Ghanaians, and a huge source of pride.   Ghana won by 2-1, and the entire bar jumped, screamed, blew whistles, and hugged in celebration of each goal.

Saturday and Sunday were leisurely days. We watched episode upon episode of our recently purchased slightly-illegally copied DVDs of the TV show The Unit.  Sunday Jacob got a hair cut  while I did some laundry ( have new respect for washing machines).  Luckily most of my things dried in the sunshine just before a sudden rain storm.  Sunday afternoon we worked with our friend Forson on the layout and advertising plans for his health newspaper, _Health Focus._

Tuesday we had extra luck finding a tro-tro home after work, thanks to the extremely light traffic.  Everyone who otherwise would have shoved and crowded tro-tros headed northwest was crowded around TVs watching the under-20 Black Stars beat South Africa 2-1. The youth national team made it to the quarter finals for the World Cup, hopefully a preview of the 2010 World Cup!****
