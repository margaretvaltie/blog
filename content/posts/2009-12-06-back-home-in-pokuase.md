Thursday Jacob and I said goodbye to Eric in Tamale.  Eric is continuing his trip through Ghana by heading east to the Volta region, then down to Accra and west to Cape Coast.  We left him with plenty of advice at the bus station, and we continued south to Kumasi.  It was a full day of driving through construction and the pothole filled road, but we made one quick stop at a waterfall.

The Kintempo Falls were right off of the road between Tamale and Kumasi, and we only walked about 5 minutes to get to the 3-part falls. The first stage is a wide, small waterfall that goes directly underground only to reappear at stage 2.  On our walk to Stage 3, we came in right after a large school group. The kids immediately stripped down to shorts and tank tops and swam in the shallow pool and played in the spray from the falls.  Jacob and I took some pictures, but decided to come back after they left.  We had a little picknick of tuna and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while we waited for the school kids to leave.  We went back to Stage 3, and Jacob went for a swim.   It was a nice little stop on our long drive.

We got into Kumasi around nightfall, and Alex found a nice hotel right across the street from his friend’s house.  We left early Friday morning to pick up our kente and get on the road before the traffic got too bad heading into Accra.  Since we had the car all day, Jacob and I decided to ask Alex to take us around to a few places in the city that otherwise are hard to get to.  Most of the city was quiet since Friday was Farmers Day- a bit like Thanksgiving Day + Labor Day, but dedicated to the farmer with the most output for the year.  We went to Oxford Street in the touristy section of Osu, where we bought a few gifts and had a wonderful lunch in a Chinese restaurant.

By about 3pm we were “home” in Pokuase.  It was so great to be back in our apartment and unpacked.  I was amazingly glad to be back under our fan, in comfortable beds, and in a familiar place.  The other 3 volunteers had left early Friday morning to do a rapid tour of Mole Park, leaving Friday and driving home Saturday night.  Only our Ghanaian compound-dwellers Hayford, Princess and Lizzie were around and we had the apartment to ourselves for a while.  Once we unpack our bags from this past week we will begin packing for home.  Jacob and I will be home in the US on Wednesday night!
