Jacob and I have been holed up reading for just about a week now.  It all went downhill when Jacob discovered an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Choice-Axis-Time-Trilogy/dp/0345457137/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270537845&sr=1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative history trilogy</a> set in WWII. We had plenty of time to read on all our flights but we kept reading and reading. We&#8217;ve been almost like drug addicts, only emerging for a few hours at a time to see a part of the city or eat something exotic.  Finally, we might be free of the addiction today as Jacob finishes up the last book in Kuala Lumper.

While I&#8217;m on the subject&#8230; might I shamelessly promote my cousin Mike&#8217;s new/ first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weeping-Underwater-Looks-Like-Laughter/dp/0399155902/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270537770&sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weeping Underwater Looks A Lot Like Laughter</a>.  He was voted one of Barns and Noble&#8217;s Great New Writers for this Spring and the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-01-28-buzzplus28_ST_N.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today likes him</a> too.
