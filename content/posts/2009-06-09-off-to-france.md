Tomorrow night Jacob and I are off to France via ferry. We have to check out by 10am, so that will make us leave early and not sleep in for once.Â  We plan to go to another town in Southern England for most of the day (hopefully we can find something to do with our bags, or else we&#8217;ll have to just carry them around all day).Â  I&#8217;m thinking we&#8217;ll go to Stonehenge tomorrow before we set out on the seas again.

We were supposed to meet up with our ship friends, Chris and Abi, today to get a little tour around the area but we haven&#8217;t heard from them. We spent the day doing laundry, planning our crossing and packing up a bit, so it wasn&#8217;t a total loss.Â  We just booked a crossing on a night ferry that leaves Portsmouth around 11pm and gets to Caen, France at 6am. It should be interesting sleeping in the reclining chairs, but at least we get the whole day to find a place to stay and get our bearings in France. I&#8217;m looking into hostels and hotels in Bayeux, near the D-Day beaches the D-Day museum and the Bayeux tapestries of William the Conqueror&#8217;s lady friend.

Hope everyone at home is doing well! We love to hear from you ðŸ™‚
