The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Chicago/events/238566203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago AWS user group</a> has been really picking up steam lately! Just a week after our last event, we had a special panel about AWS Certifications this Wednesday night at Arity.

Our 3 panelists were Chris Johnson Bidler, Ryan Koop, and Rilindo Foster. The 3 had different experiences, from taking all the tests over a few months to jamming 3 associate tests into one day!

Chris took all 3 associate-level tests in one day: AWS Solution Architect Associate, AWS Developer Associate, AWS Sysops Engineer Associate. Chris has been working in DevOps and "regular Ops" for several years, and AWS for about 3 years. Chris felt most comfortable with the SA test, and saved that one for last. He did notice a fair amount of overlap between the 3 tests, primarily in the situational questions for architecture best practices.

Ryan Koop, the Director of Products and Marketing at Cohesive Networks, has taken the SA associate level test and the AWS Certified Security — Specialty Exam. The specialty exams were just announced at reInvent 2016 and were in beta from December to February 2017. The beta tests have closed, but results aren't in yet. Ryan's experience taking the SA test and the beta test were table stakes for the company looking to hit requirements for AWS partners in the APN Advanced tier. Ryan's biggest tip is to get some hands-on experience with the AWS console along with studying materials.

Our third and final panelest was Rilindo Foster from Connecture. Rilindo said he'd been using AWS 6 months when he decided to start taking all 3 Associate level tests. Once he passed those, he move on to the 2 professional level tests: AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional and AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional.

All three panelists suggested some hands-on experience with AWS services. The top 3 to know are S3, Ec2, and VPC. While there aren't any triva question style sections, it does help to know the AWS terminology for proper context - instances for VMs, the difference between subnets and ACLs, etc.



The panelists all had used <a href="https://acloud.guru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acloud.guru</a> courses to study for the tests. The founder and voice in most videos, Ryan Kroonenburg, is an AWS-promoted instructor and he sits for certifications each year at reInvent. His tips are especially helpful for nervous test takers who want to know more details about how the tests work, what question formats are, and the timing of course content.

And here's a handy list of places to look for help studying and getting some hands-on experience with AWS:

  * AWS certification page with info on tests, costs, and timing: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/</a>
  * ACloudGuru, the AWS-approved study guide video series all 3 panelists recommended: https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate
  * AWS Documentation &#8211; with some step by step guides for setting up websites, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/</a>
  * Test FAQs for timing, retakes, costs, etc: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/faqs/</a>
