On the 3rd we took a train from Vienna to Bratislava, Slovakia and found Blues Hostel near the city center.  I guess everything is near the city center in a city of 45,000 people&#8230;

We explored the city and ate at a local Slovakia Pub for dinner. In the hostel kitchen (the cool place to hang out here) we met Julio from Sao Paulo, Brazil and 2 Pedros from Portugal.  The Pedros had been in town a few days and offered to show the rest of us around to the cool bars and clubs. We went to a few underground (literally in the basement) bars, and then took a trek to an underground club. This club was literally under the castle in former Soviet nuclear bunkers, and we&#8217;re pretty sure it&#8217;s run by the local mob.  They took only cash and served the beer in plastic cups for far less than grocery store prices. The music wasn&#8217;t exactly the American/ South Americans&#8217; thing, but our Portuguese hosts jamed out.   On our walk back to the hostel we came across some funny statues in the streets and took silly pictures.  One is a bronze statue of a &#8216;man at work&#8217; and it&#8217;s a figure leaning out of a manhole, smiling in repose.   Another was by the &#8216;paparazzi bar&#8217; and was a bronze man with a large camera leaning around the corner of the building.  The Pedros took some great photos.

The next day, the 4th of July, we explored the city and ate lunch outdoors in a cafe.  We thought it was funny that we ate Italian food in Slovakia to celebrate America.  After lunch we headed to the huge Tesco grocery store to look for American things to have a &#8216;cookout&#8217; to celebrate the holiday.  We ended up getting hamburger meat, sausages that at least looked like hot dogs, bread in the form of corresponding buns, chips, Diet Coke, beer, and french fries.  Sadly there wasn&#8217;t an oven to cook our fries, but we cooked the rest on the electric stove in the hostel kitchen and quickly made some friends.   We offered American food to some Brits, who told us about an American who was in their dorm room.  Later, they brought Jake from New York and we spent time talking about American things and cooking hot dogs.  By about 8pm our friend from the train to Vienna, Dan from Boston, arrived in town and got a room in our hostel.  Our American celebration continued until late into the night, although we never did find any fireworks.
