It's only 2 weeks away from re:Invent 2019 and that means 2 things for me as a user group leader: a huge uptick in interest in AWS, and everything about AWS will change. 

The "everything about AWS will change" part first. Amazon has already started announcements with their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chicagoaws.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b451752436abb12bd86c02b38&id=68b7a85673&e=ffabd16aad" target="_blank">Storage Day</a> and pre-re:Invent news bits. I hesitate to start something new about now since once announcement from AWS could change plans for how to build, bill, or time something. 

On the other side, re:Invent grows every year and draws more attention to the massive cloud platform. Re:Invent is massive &#8211; shameless plug for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chicagoaws.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b451752436abb12bd86c02b38&id=3cb76ea5b7&e=ffabd16aad" target="_blank">my guide to re:Invent for Introverts</a> &#8211; but it is exciting. Two years ago I remember sitting in front of two guys who talked excitedly about their plans for AWS projects the 4+ hour entire flight home. 

## AWS for absolute beginners

If you want to start from the ground up, I recommend you read a few blogs on the history and basic services AWS offers:

  * A great post of "what those services should be named"[AWS in Plain English][1] from Expedited Security
  * [AWS from A to Z][2] from AWS Data Hero Hellen Anderson
  * [A History through myth debunking][3] -from snarker-about-town Corey Quinn 
  * Assuming you know things about databases &#8211; [What is AWS? A guide for beginners][4] by Lewis Menelaws 
  * [Timeline history of AWS service announcements][5] from [@AWSGeek][6] 
  * Visual explanations for services such as [S3][7], reInvent notes, and the [Periodic Table of AWS][8] again from the great [@awsgeek][6]
  * A dive into Serverless on AWS &#8211; [Anatomy of AWS Lambda][9] 

## Learn by doing

The best documentation on AWS is &#8230; by AWS. Amazon iterates so quickly and releases so many new services and updates that no other site or organization can keep up! See [AWS.amazon.com for the full lists][10] and [docs.aws.amazon.com.][11]

The advise may sound dismissive, but start learning about AWS by doing and pick something that interests you. I started by building websites for the user group. But what guides and what services? 

  * Again AWS is the go-to for getting started guides and [Tutorials][12]. NOTE: 
  * [Open Guides][13] from AWS users and builders. NOTE: the guides haven't been updated in a year+ but the README is still a very useful read, and core AWS services aren't going anywhere.
  * [AWS Samples][14] on GitHub

If you encounter something that tells you "spin up an EC2 instance" it can be overwhelming quickly! Hellen Anderson is here again with a great article: [What EC2 is right for you?][15] But, see my warning about everything changing post-re:Invent! I suspect we'll get even more EC2 instance types.

## Security in AWS &#8211; More hands-on {#mce_26}

Tutorials and game days are a great way to dive deeper into AWS. Plus, security is "job zero" especially when you are getting started in AWS and using your own account to experiment. 

  * [fl.AWS][16] &#8211; a self-guided security tour through AWS from [Scott Piper][17] 
  * and a follow up, [http://flaws2.cloud/ ][18]
  * Browse sample AWS workshops and guides from their [GitHub][14], such as [Security Odyssey][19]
  * IAM Root: [AWS IAM Simulator Tutorial][20]
  * [OWASP's Serverless Goat][21] &#8211; a deliberately insecure realistic AWS Lambda serverless application, maintained by OWASP
