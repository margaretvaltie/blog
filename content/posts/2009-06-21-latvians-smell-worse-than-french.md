Another great day in Riga, Latvia.

We did the touristy thing today, and walked around Old Town Riga. It&#8217;s surprising to me how close everything is when you take certain curvy streets instead of the long streets on the map.  Our first stop was the Museum of Occupation. It was a very well done museum that focused on Latvian occupation from the late 1930s until the 1990s, which was Russian, German, then Russian occupations.  Ironically, the Latvians have a beautiful monument built in the late 1920s to celebrate freedom. Russians and Germans enjoyed using it for propaganda in each set of occupation.  Now, 2 Latvian solders symbolically guard Latvia&#8217;s freedom for most of every day.  Reading about the re-locations, deportations, and cultural restrictions does make me thankful for freedoms and only 2 borders in the US.

After the museum we walked around more and took pictures from the top of St. Peter&#8217;s church near the river. It&#8217;s a beautiful church that was begun in the 1300s (I think), added on to in the 1700s, and bombed and rebuilt in 1941.  There are many beautiful pictures of the tower in flames during the war and occupations. Germans had powerful propaganda that blamed Russian atrocities on Jews and Communism with the churches in flames behind the messages.  Sadly since the Soviets time here it hasn&#8217;t had much demand to be used as a church. We took a smelly elevator ride up to the top of the tower (packed with Latvians and Russians), where we could only walk around the tiny railing of the second-highest part of the tower. The view was amazing.

Next, we walked on to the modern bridge to look back at the city and the castle.  Apparently Latvia has some of the best Art Nouveau architecture mixed in with the old churches, banks, and palaces. I&#8217;m a big fan of Riga now and I would be very interested to see what happens in the next 10 years.  Reunion trip?
