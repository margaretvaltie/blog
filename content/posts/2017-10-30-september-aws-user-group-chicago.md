It's been a few weeks, but I wanted to write down some thoughts on the latest AWS Chicago user group. An ever popular topic is certification, mainly for AWS' own professional exams, but also things form CISCO to Microsoft certifications.

This time we opted for an open-ended format of the &#8220;unpanel&#8221; an idea I borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudCamp</a> (RIP Chicago CloudCamp). The goal is to get more people involved than a standard Q&A of &#8220;experts&#8221; on a panel. By sourcing panel participants from the crowd, people can both ask and answer questions and swap in and out.

In the space, wonderfully sponsored by Discover, the layout was great. Pizza and drinks (sadly no beer allowed) were off to the side, and the audience and panel were squished into the narrow part of the room so everyone was forced to be right in the action.

Running an unpanel in Chicago is always a challenge to me. Compared to the London CloudCamp, us Midwesterners are too nice to jump in and take over someone's spot on the panel. As the moderator, I tried to be aggressive in both bringing more people up to the panel chairs, rotating questions from the group, and swapping out speakers as needed.

From an AWS side, I was surprised to hear not many Chicago folks are headed to re:Invent this year. It is a strange time, just after Thanksgiving, to go to Vegas as the big projects of the year wrap up. It's also becoming such a huge event. Last year over 40,000 people jammed into the Venetian/Sands/MGM and this year it's taking over most of the Strip. Just walking down the hallway is overwhelming, much less the normal of Vegas overload.

Another note, was that more and more people are looking to certify. AWS certifications are affordable compared to most others.
