Thursday night’s rendezvous with Lauren did not go as planned.  After work, Jacob and I got into a cab BossMan arranged for us and drove to the gas station on the part of Cantonments Road know to locals as ‘Oxford Street’.  Osu, the part of town, is the touristy center of Accra and the street vendors selling name bracelets, drums, posters, pirated DVDs, and various other items decened on the spot where students waited for their shuttles back to the [Semester at Sea][1] ship.

We waited for 2 shuttles to come and go, and although some students knew who Lauren was no one knew if she was around.  Finally I found Kate, who’d been on the overnight excusion with Lauren the night before told me the trip was delayed by hours. Apparently the 1 ½ hour bus ride actually took 4 hours, and Lauren wouldn’t get back to the ship until 9pm.  We headed home to Pokuase with our cab driver, stopping by the after-work hangout of our boss. It was a bit strange.

Lauren called me later Thursday night and we planned to meet up the next morning before they had to report back and her ship sailed.  We met at the gas station and she and her 2 friends, Rosa and Jennifer, took us to a fair trade shop she worked with during her time on land here, called [Global Mamas][2].  The [store][3] is online too.  Next, we took them to lunch in a chop bar (food bar) off of the main road and introduced them to banku, foufou and the wonders of FanIce. They were all exicted and amazed to realize that we spent 5GHC total for all five of us- or less than $1 each.

We decided to spend their time shopping for things they wanted on the streets such as a flag pin, stickers, a jersey and a thimble.  Jacob happily negotiated for the 3 ladies since they were all weary of bargaining for everything they bought. We successfully got all the items except for everything Lauren wanted, of course.  I promised to search for a sticker and thimble since I have 3 more months of shopping.  Lauren’s friends ran off to an ‘internet cafe’ while Lauren borrowed my phone to call her parents and I tried on a few dresses in a stall on the street.  I made a successful purchase of 2 baggy, tamer-print dresses and we headed back to the shuttle spot.  I said a long goodbye to LG- she’s off to South Africa and east to India, China and other exciting locales.

That night after Anne’s last day of teaching we decided to go dancing in the restaurant/ club in the Accra Mall, where our friend PK is the DJ.  We planned to leave in time to get a bite to eat before the music started, but with typical Accra traffic and timing we arrived ravenous around the same time PK did. We ate wonderful, if overpriced, Western food and danced away to American, African, and Ghanaian hip-hop and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiplife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-life</a> music.

Saturday Anne wanted to go souvenir shopping on one of her last days, despite our late start from sleeping in. We headed back to Oxford Street and even visited the same lady who sold me my dresses the day before.  Anne found dresses and shirts for her sisters, boyfriend, and brother and she’s prepared to outfit her entire family now. We walked the street and bargained for a while, and worked up a hunger.  We decided to try the super cheap chop bar from the day before also.  As we sat down outside our waitress told us the kitchen was closed, but we could order food. We were confused at first, but we realized she was going to get all the components of our meal from other places and then bring them to us. We ordered and re-ordered once she went to each of the 3 places to buy rice, kenkey, and boiled yams and the corresponding light stew and pepper soups for us. We had a great time watching the complicated organization our meal required and talking until late at night.

Sunday Jacob and I stayed home while Anne went to the pool with our volunteer director, Hayford/BTC, and his girlfriend.  At sundown Yom Kippur began and Jacob and his father orchestrated an elaborate plan for Jacob to listen in to his Chicago synagogue’s services via Skype and his cell phone.  Rather than going to the services, his dad stayed home to listen to the prayers and sermon with his son, a hemisphere away.
