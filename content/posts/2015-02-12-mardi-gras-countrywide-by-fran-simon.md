With a playlist of Carnival-time music, the Chicagoans were ready to party New Orleans–style.

As Chicago was in the throes of contending with an accumulation of a foot and a half of snow, two Tulane University alumni were awaiting delivery of a box of throws.

Aneesha Marwah and Margaret Walker, co-presidents of the Tulane Club of Chicago who both graduated in 2009, were planning a Mardi Gras bash for Friday (Feb. 13). They needed king cakes, beads and Tulane University swag. And they had to convince an Old Town club to make jambalaya and red beans and rice. With a playlist of Carnival-time music, the Chicagoans were ready to party New Orleans–style.

“Last year, we were hoping for 50 people and we got about 150,” Marwah said. “Our club came back to life.”

She said the Chicago club’s recent events have helped bring together alumni from all parts of town. Club members have used various rendezvous events, such as a Green Wave football-watching party, to build social networks with others now living in Chicago.

Other Tulane clubs across the country also threw Mardi Gras parties for alumni. The Tulane Club of Las Vegas held its third Cocktails and Carnival event. The Tulane Club of New England held a Mardi Gras Happy Hour, and there were big Mardi Gras parties in Washington, D.C., and New York. After a three-year hiatus, Houston hosted a Mardi Gras brunch at Brennan’s of Houston. Orlando, Florida, held a family-friendly party.

Next up this spring is a spate of crawfish boils for far-flung alumni. There will be an estimated 32 events, from San Diego and Los Angeles, to Chicago, New York and Miami.
