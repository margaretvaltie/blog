My personal blog has evolved from a travel blog to a blog about my work and life in Chicago technology communities. 

I was fortunate enough to be able to travel in 2009 - 2010 and kept a record of my thoughts here.
In 2009 I traveled through Eastern Europe and volunteered in Ghana for several months. After a brief trip home for the holidays, I went back out in 2010 on an Around the World ticket through South America, Australia and New Zealand, Southeast Asia and South Africa. The goal was to keep it simple- live out of backpacks, stay in hostels, meet interesting people, see the sights and experience the culture of each location.

In 2010 I moved  to Chicago and began my career journey from a green tech startup to marketing for a cloud network startup. Since at Cohesive Networks in 2012, I learned and blogged about technology, marketing, as well as event organizing, small business operations, and social media. I dove into the  technical side as I learned more about websites, networking, and AWS cloud community. After a short gig in consulting, I am now a Program Manager on the Cloud Services team at Morningstar. 

This is my space to share what I've learned in an attempt to help others and just record my progress. I hope to never stop learning!
